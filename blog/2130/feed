&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, June 27, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday was made for jazz. As the sun began to set upon the Toronto Star Stage at Nathan Philips square, people hurriedly made their way into the packed tent. Unlike the previous night&#039;s stormy demeanor, the weather (which was beautiful) foreshadowed what was to come. Breakdancers were rehearsing at a nearby stage, wheat beer was being gulped, and people were taking selfies next to Eric Harland’s drum kit. Indeed, it was a very special night in Toronto jazz: legendary bassist Dave Holland’s PRISM and renowned guitarist John Scofield’s Überjam were about to take the stage for a grand co-headlining event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRISM kicked off the night, unassumingly trotting onto the stage without a word, and letting their music talk with the song “New Day.” Holland opened with a warm, curious bass line to entice the crowd. Drummer Eric Harland slowly chimed in with his dark, dreamy and trashy cymbals to set the ambience. The song progressed into a 15-minute jam, during which everyone had a chance to solo, including Holland with an especially pensive breakdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band progressed into the song “Evolution,” which featured the players using their instruments in creative ways. Sticks were slid across cymbals, fingers plucked the piano strings and the guitar created a warm coo as if played like a violin. The song gradually evolved into a soft funk groove, and eventually crescendoed into a progressive rock peak. This formula was repeated multiple times, keeping the audience breathless throughout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By “The True Meaning of Determination,” the band definitely had the crowd’s attention. Tapping their toes (perhaps the most enthusiastic expression of appreciation that a jazz audience can give), everyone was happily jamming along with the band. However, throughout the set, the band remained utterly focused, putting everything into every note. This was only broken when an audience member dropped a beer bottle, the reaction to which brought a hilarious millisecond of perplexed looks from everyone in the band before they returned to playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the festival has been plagued with some sound issues for the past few days, everything was spot on for PRISM, who closed their set with “Empty Chair” and “The Watcher.” It was beautiful to witness the contrasting styles between songs that were written by different band members—each turning into an extended jam, much to the audience’s delight. The set ended just as powerfully as it began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Scofield’s Überjam—which includes Andy Hess on bass, Avi Bortnick on rhythm guitar and Tony Mason on drums—was all about variety. Each member brought a unique style to their Wednesday evening performance, and the group covered a plethora of genres, keeping the audience on its toes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opener “Snake Dance” was a funky latin blues shuffle with electronic elements. This was followed by “Cracked Ice,” a funk jam that transitioned into a disco groove. Both songs featured complex layers of guitar work and heavy loops and sampling courtesy of Bortnick. While Scofield gave his bandmates time to shine, he occupied the majority of the songs with his smooth, long and soulful solos. He also kept his songs malleable, providing vocal cues when it was time to cut to a riff or a bridge. Most admirable, however, was the appreciation that he showed for the band. Constantly introducing them between songs and crying out “look at this guy!” during their solos, the guitarist seemed humbled to be surrounded by such great talent. This positivity kept the band in great spirits throughout the set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “Jungle Fiction,” a spacey, experimental song laden with percussion, a brilliant flanging effect made Mason’s cymbals sound distant and eerie. This set the mood until he was joined by the guitar which peaked into a post-rock/experimental jam. The song featured frequent drum and guitar solos with a distinct free jazz feeling of liberation only to return to a structured melody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this wasn’t enough, the following songs were a soulful, reggae song a la Al Green followed by an Afrobeat, Latin funk jam reminiscent of Souljazz Orchestra. Überjam was full of surprises and had incredible chemistry together. Combined with PRISM, Thursday was truly the night of the supergroup. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lettuce &amp; The Dirty Dozen Live Concert Review</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/blog/lettuce-dirty-dozen-live-concert-review</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-blogpic field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/lettuce2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lettuce &amp;amp; The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Live Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Benjamin Thomas&lt;br /&gt;
TDJ News Corps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, June 26, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain should never stop anyone from dancing. On Wednesday night, it poured down on the few people frantically running to the Toronto Star Stage in Nathan Philips Square for shelter—and for a set from Brooklyn funk outfit Lettuce. With less than half the venue filled, things seemed grim as the openers, the legendary Dirty Dozen Brass Band, took the stage. The twelve seasoned veterans looked down at the sparse crowd and, rather than being disgruntled, pointed out each person that they saw with a smile on their face. The band used every bit of enthusiasm and energy and channeled it into its performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dirty Dozen formed 37 years ago in the hopes of preserving classic New Orleans jazz. However, their time together has been an iterative process. Over the years, the band developed a sound frontman Gregory Davis compares to gumbo (a traditional southern dish combining various flavours and spices). After a brief dismissal of the rain, Davis and his bandmates got the ball rolling with an energetic dance number that inspired the crowd to stand up and clap along. Numbers like “Do It Fluid” and “Tomorrow” kept the pace going, albeit with very similar sounding jams. But the band did offer ample time for players to solo and really shine through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again at the festival, sound-mixing was an issue, with the drums heavily clipping and the trumpets too low in the mix. Kevin Harris and Davis kept signalling for the engineer to push up the levels but, seasoned pros as they are, when trouble hit they simply jumped to another mic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the Dozen’s set was much smoother. They called up multiple girls to dance along with their songs, and the crowd followed suit; the venue became increasingly full as passersby joined the fun. By the end of their set, the band had transitioned flawlessly from New Orleans jams to afro-funk grooves and had the whole crowd standing at attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lettuce took to the stage, it seemed clear very few people knew what to expect from the young funk ensemble. Many older audience members sat in their chairs, arms folded. However, after their opening number everyone understood—Lettuce is the epitome of funk. Drummer Adam Deitch and his band came through with vengeance. With a saxophonist and a trumpeter, the brass section was a full group of its own, blaring through sexy solos and adding the extra “oomph” to the breakbeats. Soulive cohorts Eric Krasno and Neal Evans added their signature chicken-grease flavour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking just a few seconds between songs to thank the audience, Lettuce moved from jam to jam, consistently raising the bar. If the Dirty Dozen got people dancing, Lettuce had them shaking feverishly. By around the band`s third song, the entire open floor around the seated area was populated by young fans making dance circles and other young listeners joining the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band brought out singer Alecia Chakour for three songs, the announcement of which had some dancers concerned the show would turn into an R&amp;amp;B slow jam. They were wrong. Belting out the sassiest and most powerful vocals of the night, Chakour and the band continued the momentum, and closed out one of the liveliest performances of the festival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Lettuce had even the most skeptical of jazz aficionados whooping and hollering for their new, daring approach to funk. The venue was damp and sweaty but full of bright energy, contrasting with the dark pouring rain outside. With fat drums, powerful horns and groovy bass lines, Lettuce needs to let &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; hear more.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hiromi: The Trio Project Live Concert Review</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/blog/hiromi-trio-project-live-concert-review</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-blogpic field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/htp.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hiromi: The Trio Project, Live&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Benjamin Thomas&lt;br /&gt;
TDJ News Corps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, June 24, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a child within all of us—a spirit that comes alive when we do things like, say, skipping out on work to catch a show at the jazz festival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pianist Hiromi Uehara, who is known to her fans as simply Hiromi, channelled that same childlike spirit Tuesday night. After stepping onto the beautiful Koerner Hall stage alongside bassist Anthony Jackson and drummer Simon Philips, she dove right into the title track from her trio’s second album, &lt;i&gt;Move&lt;/i&gt;. Barely able to keep herself on her seat, Hiromi swayed and rocked as she mashed the piano, lost in euphoria. A calm, composed Jackson watched her every move for subtle cues, playing with warmth and grace, while Philips lay down grooves that perfectly complemented his bandmates. After weaving in and out of very complex patterns seamlessly, the trio’s five minutes of beautifully organized chaos came crashing to an end. And the child inside Hiromi returned to that very place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping away from the piano, Hiromi gave a humble introduction, drawing attention toward her bandmates and thanking the crowd.  The trio then launched into “Wanderer” from its recently released album, &lt;i&gt;Alive&lt;/i&gt;. The aptly titled song makes sharp transitions, painting a beautiful picture of the ups and downs of any journey. The trio’s performance gave ample room for Philips, who opted out of bringing a traditional, smaller jazz kit to bring along his massive rock set, fully equipped with twin bass drums, heavy cymbals (including a massive china crash that practically blocked him entirely from view), and two snares that cracked throughout the auditorium. Rather than the funky sound associated with Hiromi’s Sonicbloom side project, Philips played with a ferocity clearly influenced by his prolific history as an in-demand rock session drummer. While this often brought out the emotion in most of the songs, the kit was too loud in the mix, often drowning out both Jackson and Hiromi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the third song, a pair of latecomers straggled into their seats. Hiromi greeted them with a cheery smile and playfully repeated the first chord of the next song until they were seated. Once this was done, she went right back into action. Covering more songs from their latest album, the trio played perfectly together and looked like they couldn’t be happier. Jackson finally got time to show off his licks, performing some call-and-response with Hiromi. This solo allowed the crowd to experience Jackson fully, as he was somewhat drowned out earlier in the performance; the solo demonstrated the true warmth in his tone and depth of his technical skills. As he staggered loosely around the bar-line, audience members wore pleasantly disgusted expressions, as if they were tasting an unexpectedly spicy meal. Jackson proved he had a groove that added a cool jazz element to the trio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the night progressed, the band pushed itself to its very limits, performing a variety of songs across all of its albums, and then closed the show with an enchanting solo number by Hiromi entitled “Firefly,” showcasing the versatility in her style and the subtle beauty of her compositions. While she is known to have some of the fastest hands in jazz, she plays with an entrancing elegance that brings about layers of emotion. A small microphone that she used to greet the crowd sat atop her piano. As she progressed through the set, cries of &quot;yeah!&quot; and &quot;play on!&quot; could be heard as she joyfully gazed over at her two companions. During her solos, she would also hum along to the keys she was playing, adding a brilliantly human touch to her dizzyingly fast performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there were some minor issues with the sound mixing in the hall, Hiromi: The Trio Project put on a breathtaking performance of raw energy and skill. &lt;i&gt;Alive&lt;/i&gt; was definitely more than an album title—it was the moral of the story.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Drummers of the 2014 Toronto Jazz Festival</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/blog/drummers-2014-toronto-jazz-festival</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-blogpic field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/drums.jpg&quot; width=&quot;536&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drummers of the Toronto Jazz Festival 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Benjamin Thomas&lt;br /&gt;
TDJ News Corps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, June 24, 2014:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drummers are, arguably, the least celebrated instrumentalists in the jazz world, with the drummer’s role analogous to the heart—a highly skilled and artful sustaining of the band’s pulse. As such, the players are often taken for granted because they are simply expected to function at their peak. But with increasing experimentation in popular jazz, one-off side projects such as Mehliana are heightening awareness of the hidden world of percussion-driven music. This year’s festival features an impressive array of drummers. Here’s the scoop on just a handful of the percussive talents who hit festival stages this week and are sure to get your heart pumping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark Guiliana / Mehliana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Toronto Star Stage – Nathan Philips Square, 8p.m., Sat. June 28, 2014&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Over a decade ago, this New Jersey drummer blazed onto the scene with lightning fast technique and unparalleled ferocity. While his projects with Donny McCaslin, Lionel Loueke and Gretchen Parlato showcased his ease and skill playing in a multitude of genres, it was during his time with Avishai Cohen that he truly began to shine.  Blending the perfect pocket of Chris Dave with the dirty drum&#039;n&#039;bass of Jojo Mayer, and delivering it with a unique twist of trashy tones, Guiliana added a certain je ne sais quoi to Cohen’s beautiful, worldly melodies. Guiliana’s latest project, Mehliana, puts him alongside acclaimed pianist Brad Mehldau. While it may often take a band up to ten members to create a full-bodied sound, the two are sure to fill up any room – both musically and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notable tracks:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Nu Nu&lt;/i&gt; (Avishai Cohen), &lt;i&gt;Locked in a Basement&lt;/i&gt; (HEERNT), &lt;i&gt;Now vs. Now&lt;/i&gt; (Jason Lindner), &lt;i&gt;Swimming&lt;/i&gt; (Mehliana).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/VScRIvrOawY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Robert “Sput” Searight / Snarky Puppy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Horseshoe Tavern, 8p.m., Mon. June 23, 2014&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Words cannot do justice to describe Snarky Puppy. Through a seemingly impossible blend of funk, jazz, world, rock and hip hop, the band manages to push the envelope further and further with every release. One of the most powerful forces in band is drummer Sput. Never breaking a sweat, he unleashes some of the grooviest rhythms in jazz. It must be said that Sput is complemented by Snarky Puppy&#039;s equally talented percussionist Nate Werth, a dynamic duo that functions as a single unit. Sput has also toured with music heavyweights Erykah Badu, Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg and Justin Timberlake, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notable tracks:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hello Fear&lt;/i&gt; (Kirk Franklin), &lt;i&gt;The Good Man Delivered and the Best is Blessed&lt;/i&gt; (Snarky Puppy), &lt;i&gt;Slow Demon&lt;/i&gt; (Snarky Puppy), &lt;i&gt;Flood&lt;/i&gt; (Snarky Puppy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/r_iYDLRLmrM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Simon Philips / Hiromi: The Trio Project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Koerner Hall, 8p.m., Tues. June 24, 2014&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Those familiar with Hiromi Uehara’s early work may have been surprised when she chose Simon Philips as the drummer in her trio. Given his extensive experience as a rock session drummer for the likes of The Who, Tears for Fears and Judas Priest, Philips brings the thrashing energy required to complement Hiromi’s spirited style. Sitting behind his massive trademark kit, he delivers to listeners a variety of tones that add an extra punch to a traditional record. As a proficient all-rounder, Philips is one of the main reasons that Hiromi’s trio has such a refreshingly unique vibe. Though he’s a veteran in the game, he’s got a bag of tricks that goes deeper than many ever expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notable tracks:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Desire&lt;/i&gt; (Hiromi), &lt;i&gt;Blue Wind&lt;/i&gt; (Jeff Beck), &lt;i&gt;Resolution&lt;/i&gt; (Vantage Point)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/SFGkvF_rK-A&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Adam Deitch / Lettuce&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Toronto Star Stage – Nathan Philips Square, 8p.m., Wed. June 25, 2014&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Breakbeats. One of the funkiest drummers today comes in the form of Adam Deitch, who plays in groups ranging from John Scofield’s Uberjam to DJ Quik’s touring band. His specialty? You guessed it. Behind his traditional aluminum snare, Deitch packs some of the nastiest breakbeats today. He cites hip hop as a major influence, and it comes out clearly in some of his side projects including Break Science, which blends dubstep, trip hop, funk and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notable tracks:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Take the Sun Away&lt;/i&gt; (Pretty Lights), &lt;i&gt;Beaming Up&lt;/i&gt; (Break Science), &lt;i&gt;Last Suppit&lt;/i&gt; (Lettuce)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/IT2eFQUOhys&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Other great drummers to check out at Toronto Downtown Jazz this week:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Eric Harland (PRISM)&lt;br /&gt;
Stanton Moore (Galactic)&lt;br /&gt;
Louis Cato (Bobby McFerrin)&lt;br /&gt;
John Paris (Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hiromi Uehara: Alive in the Moment</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/blog/hiromi-uehara-alive-moment</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-blogpic field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Hiromi.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiromi Uehara: Alive in the Moment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Benjamin Thomas&lt;br /&gt;
TDJ News Corps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNE 12, 2014&lt;br /&gt;
Jazz piano virtuoso Hiromi Uehara is a woman of few words and calm in conversation—a stark and surprising contrast to the feverish energy and pace of her inspired live performances. During my recent chat with Hiromi about her latest album, &lt;i&gt;Alive&lt;/i&gt; (Telarc), the 35-year-old Japanese-born improviser and composer touched on topics beyond the realm of jazz, and never failed to surprise me with colourful responses that were peppered with bits of wisdom between the lines. Hiromi: The Trio Project—featuring Hiromi, bassist Anthony Jackson and drummer Simon Philips— plays on Tuesday June 24th at 8 p.m. in Koerner Hall. Be sure to check them out! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto Downtown Jazz: How’s this tour going so far?&lt;br /&gt;
Hiromi Uehara: It’s been great. Everywhere we go, we try to make things exciting for everyone, and we’ve been having a great time ourselves. Anthony and Simon are both great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ:  How did you first meet Anthony and Simon?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: Anthony I met when I was making my debut record, &lt;i&gt;Another Mind&lt;/i&gt;, in 2003. I had him on as a special guest, and he was on my second album as well. He only played three tracks, and since then I’ve been wanting to make a whole album with him, but was just waiting for the right moment. Then in 2010 I asked him if he would be interested in being a part of the trio, and he was very happy to do it. I started to write songs for us and, in the process, I started to see a clearer image of how I wanted the drums to sound. Then I thought about Simon and asked Anthony about him because they’ve been working together for over 30 years. After that discussion, I immediately contacted Simon who was happy to be a part of the project as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: It’s amazing to hear the different styles everyone brings to the trio. Last time you were here, the trio played material from your first two albums, &lt;i&gt;Voice&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Move&lt;/i&gt;. With Alive coming out next week, how would you say your sound has evolved?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: Well, the more we play together, it just gets better. Actually, better is not the right word. We just understand each other better, and know each others&#039; styles so well, and always want to surprise each other. In the songwriting process, during the first two albums, it was like I had a backing band, but now it’s the band that’s helping bring the song together from the start. I feel like they are making me write the songs that I want to play with them alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: So do you write together as well?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: No, I write my own songs. But by understanding more about each musician’s style, I started to write from different aspects. I want to hear how the song is played by Simon and how it is played by Anthony. It’s kind of like when you’re a screenwriter, and you initially write the part and seek out the actor to fill it. But later on, you may write a role with a certain person in mind. For &lt;i&gt;Voice&lt;/i&gt;, I had the script and was looking for an actor. But now I know who’s going to act in [my] play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: You’ve said that your new album, &lt;i&gt;Alive&lt;/i&gt;, focuses more closely on the live component—hence the title—but also is a play on the concept of life itself. Can you elaborate?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: I wanted to write songs about the various emotions you encounter in life. The first track is sort of like waking up, being born and starting to live. Then as you go on, you live, you dream, you wonder, you see, you play. You’re the warrior of your life. Then sometimes you need to let things go. You encounter certain moments where you need to say bye, the end. [With] anything you encounter, nothing is forever. The track “Firefly” is named that because they have short lives but they really shine when they’re alive. The album is trying to carry the spirit of what you encounter in life. The whole thing is a continuous story. It’s also about playing live because we’ve been playing together for so long and I wanted us—even in a studio setting—to bring out the emotions of a live performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: What motivates you to get through this life that you’ve describe so beautifully?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: It’s definitely playing a show every night. I love performing. Never get tired of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: I’ve seen you perform many times, and you’re always completely in the zone and utterly focused. What are you thinking about when you’re on stage?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: It’s all improvisational so I’m just trying to focus and find the right note to play. It’s like talking to people, it’s something you can’t plan when you’re in a conversation. You go with the flow. It’s so easy to say words that don’t need to be there so I’m just trying to find the words that need to. And the ones I haven’t spoken before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: I definitely think you pick all the right words.&lt;br /&gt;
HU: Not everyday, but I try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: Your music has been influenced by your time with some of the greats like Chick Corea and Ahmad Jamal, but what are some of your influences outside of jazz?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: Frank Zappa. He’s been a hero of mine for many years, and I grew up listening to him. I really like the way he writes for the band and for himself. But, for influence, I don’t know how or where it comes out. Any artist&#039;s style is a combination of all of the influences in their life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: If you weren’t playing music, what would you be doing in life?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: Eating [laughs]!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: When I say “jazz,” what’s the first word that comes to mind?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: Freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDJ: You made your first record in your early twenties. What wisdom can you pass on to young musicians—those who want to live to play music?&lt;br /&gt;
HU: They need to understand that—no matter the venue, no matter how small the crowd is—just give it your all. When I was studying at Berklee, there would be classroom concerts with 30 people but I always played like it was my first and last show. When you do that everyday, it becomes your treasure. Even with continuous shows, I don’t think about where I’m going tomorrow and what’ll happen next, I just give everything to the people that happen to be there. It’s a miracle that people decide to spend their precious time with me, so I feel a responsibility to deliver and don’t want to take you for granted. I want for the portion of our lives that we spend together to be wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
