 <title>Robert Randolph &amp; Kenny Wayne Shepherd</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/blog/robert-randolph-kenny-wayne-shepherd</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Robert Randolph and the Family Band took the stage, I was wondering if had been some form of miscommunication. I thought to myself, &quot;Where is everyone?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was expecting than the 200-some people who enthusiastically cheered as Randolph began his set with unaccompanied blues soloing. When he and I spoke on the phone, Randolph said the Toronto audience could expect &quot;almost being at a Sly and the Family Stone show or a Jimi Hendrix show.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proved to be true as the set included the classic Hendrix tune &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, and the band reminded me of the 1970 Hendrix album and group, &lt;i&gt;Band of Gypsys&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band certainly had the freedom of the 1960&#039;s and 1970&#039;s. Not only did the band members switch instruments numerous times, but at one point Randolph invited anybody in the audience capable of playing guitar on stage to jam! While I contemplated putting up my hand, 17 year old Andrew Prince was already on stage. His soloing impressed both the band and the audience, and it was endearing to see Prince shake his head in disbelief as he was playing along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set ended with the R&amp;amp;B classic &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; and an original composition titled &quot;Brand New Wayo&quot; on the band&#039;s new album &lt;i&gt;Lickety Split&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Kenny Wayne Shepherd took the stage, the audience was fired up. Shepherd began his set much like Randolph&#039;s, with unaccompanied blues soloing. I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes when I saw that Chris Layton, of Stevie Ray Vaughan fame, was playing drums! The band sounded like a classic blues band, thanks not only to Layton but to bassist Tony Franklin and Riley Osbourn on keys. Osbourn chooses to play through a Leslie speaker, an extremely expensive and delicate amplifier with rotating speakers. The Leslie speaker was used prominently among R&amp;amp;B keyboardists in the 1960&#039;s, but modern keyboardists now tend to gravitate towards amplifiers that are compact and digital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set featured some of the band&#039;s original songs, with lead singer Noah Hunt singing &quot;How I Go&quot; and &quot;Everything is Broken&quot;. When it came time to do blues covers, Kenny Wayne was all over it. I prefer Shepherd&#039;s singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd sang the Stevie Ray Vaughan classic &quot;The House is Rockin&#039;&quot; and &quot;I Can&#039;t Hold Out&quot; by Elmore James. Like Randolph, Shepherd&#039;s band performed a Bo Diddley song, as Hunt sang &quot;You Can&#039;t Judge a Book by the Cover&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd ended his set with a series of B.B. King covers. The audience cheered as Shepherd emulated King&#039;s tone and melodies on songs such as &quot;Sweet Little Angel&quot; and &quot;You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now&quot; from the landmark album &lt;i&gt;Live At the Regal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an encore, the band performed &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; by Jimi Hendrix. Shepherd performed a solo with the guitar behind his head while the audience rose to their feet with enthusiasm. While Shepherd and Randolph may not have the same sized audiences as Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix, the spirit of the music is alive in well in the hands and voices of these two young men. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Deborah Cox &amp; Melissa Etheridge</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/blog/deborah-cox-melissa-etheridge</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was no ordinary jazz concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands gathered in Nathan Phillips Square to kick off World Pride. Premier Kathleen Wynne made a surprise appearance to anoint the festival, promising to make Ontario the most accepting place on earth for the LGBTQ community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere was lively, though the crowd&#039;s enthusiasm made some of the guest speakers difficult to understand at times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Deborah Cox and Melissa Etheridge were scheduled in collaboration with the jazz festival, the audiences was also treated to some of World Pride&#039;s entertainers. The festivities began with the &quot;O Canada&quot; sung in Ojibwe, followed by a traditional dance troupe and a spiritual blessing by an elder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Robinson opened up the musical performances. The audience sang in unison as Robinson sang his 1975 anthem &quot;Glad to Be Gay&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago native Steve Grand gave a short set at the keyboards accompanied by guitar and banjo. The set was a collection of life-affirming up-tempo songs in the teen pop genre. Grand ended his set with his viral hit &quot;All-American Boy&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Deborah Cox took the stage the sunlight was gone. As the lights of Nathan Phillips square shone, she performed atop a fountain with only her microphone and two back-up dancers. Cox began her set with a high energy performance of &quot;Who Do U Love&quot;. Her powerful voice stayed strong throughout the set, delivering some impressive notes. Canada should be proud to be able to claim such a world class vocalist. A highlight of the set was &quot;Beautiful U R&quot;. Song title spelling aside, the lyrics were perfectly suited to World Pride. It was very moving to see an ocean of rainbow flags proudly waving as Cox passionately proclaimed &quot;Don&#039;t ever let nobody tear your world apart.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Melissa Etheridge finally took the stage the audience was beyond enthused. In addition to performing fan favourites such as &quot;I Want To Come Over&quot; and &quot;Come To My Window&quot;, Etheridge made some important announcements. The crowd roared as Etheridge announced that she had gotten married three weeks ago. She also announced a new album titled &lt;i&gt;September&lt;/i&gt;, set to be released September 30. Etheridge debuted new material from that album, but the biggest surprise was yet to come. Serena Ryder joined on vocals for an unforgettable duet of &quot;Bring Me Some Water&quot;.  Another unique feature of this concert was that there was a woman signing the lyrics of every single performer to the audience. This effort did not go unnoticed as Etheridge acknowledged the effort, as did the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under all of these surprises was a set of quality material. The performance ended with &quot;Like The Way I Do&quot;. The band walked off during the number, save for Etheridge and her drummer. Etheridge performed a self contained acoustic solo, she then soloed on the drums alongside her drummer. The rest of the band came back from the wings for a grand rock and roll cadenza. The crowd had been on their feet all day, and yet they tirelessly begged for an encore. Though Etheridge did not return to the stage, the crowd was appeased with a dazzling display of rainbow fireworks while &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; played. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was no ordinary jazz concert, but a piece of Toronto history we can all take pride in.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Chaka Khan &amp; Shemekia Copeland</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/blog/chaka-khan-shemekia-copeland</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a way to kick off the festival!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the rest of Toronto indulged in the World Cup and NXNE, there was a small yet passionate crowd at Kool Haus to see Chaka Khan and opener Shemekia Copeland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copeland is a 35 year-old blues singer reminiscent of the soul powerhouses of Stax Records. Her band proved more than capable of delivering the blues, in particular guitarist Arthur Neilson, with whom Copeland has been touring with for 16 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Shemekia Copeland introduced her song &quot;Lemon Pie&quot;, she mentioned that it belonged to an album she released in 2012 titled &lt;i&gt;33 1/3&lt;/i&gt;. She is particularly proud of this album, she told the audience, because it was nominated for a Grammy in the sole remaining blues category. This in spite of those who insist Copeland&#039;s blues is not authentic. The title is a double entendre as it not only refers to vinyl RPM, but also to the fact that Copeland herself was 33 while recording the album&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copeland prefaced her final song with an anecdote about her grandmother&#039;s North Carolina gospel church. Copeland announced that she was about to take the audience to her grandmother&#039;s church before erupting into &quot;Stand Up &amp;amp; Testify&quot;, an up-tempo rave that managed to pump a little life into an audience that was lukewarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chaka Khan was introduced, the audience&#039;s demeanor change. While the crowd could best have been described as tepid during Shemekia Copeland&#039;s performance, they were five times as excited when Chaka Khan&#039;s band was setting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she took the stage, the crowd erupted. The audience of several hundred, some of whom brought chairs, stayed on their feet for the entirety of Chaka&#039;s set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show opened with &quot;Keeps Me Satisfied&quot;. Chaka sang and looked as if she had come straight from the &#039;80s. As the band shifted into &quot;I&#039;m a Woman&quot;, her vocals intensified, bringing the song to a rave-up reminiscent of Otis Redding&#039;s live performances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaka was anything but a diva. The backup vocalists were given solos, along with every band member. At one point Chaka and the other vocalists left the stage so that the band could individually showcase their instrumental prowess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of divas, she doesn&#039;t see herself that way. Ms. Khan told the crowd, &quot;I&#039;m an angel, like all of you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night ended with &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot;. Chaka divided the crowd into men and women and let the audience sing the chorus while she riffed. Although there were some issues with microphone feedback and vocal monitors, Chaka and her band handled them with poise and elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the concert, fans Annette Landoi Zer-aviv and Sandi Bauer were delighted with the performance. &quot;I&#039;ve been a fan of Chaka Khan since I was really young - preteen years&quot; Landoi Zer-Aviv said. &quot;Being a singer, she&#039;s been one of my inspirations. She&#039;s an amazing singer, very soulful.&quot; Bauer was also impressed. &quot;Her range is unbelievable&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Kool Haus was not exactly packed, the evening&#039;s performances captivated the couple hundred in attendance. The blues is alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>
