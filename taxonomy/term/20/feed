 <title>What&#039;s so good about Darcy James Argue?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-darcy-james-argue</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/darcy-james-argues-secret-society&quot;&gt;Darcy James Argue&amp;#039;s Secret Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay - full disclosure.  I run a big band, which means I&#039;m predisposed to liking big bands.  And I&#039;ve played one of Darcy&#039;s charts, which means I&#039;m predisposed to liking his music.  And I&#039;ve seen the Secret Society several times, which means I&#039;m predisposed to liking the band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of that should matter because regardless of predispositions or biases, it&#039;s all fantastic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can sometimes be the case, separating out the band leader from the band is tricky.  The Secret Society is Darcy&#039;s instrument; big band is his main performance outlet.  But he has made a name for himself as an outstanding composer for ensembles of all sizes: in addition to performances and commissions with big bands in North America, Europe and Australia, he has composed for chamber duo and string quartet, art songs, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.  He&#039;s earned awards, grants and fellowships from New Music USA, the Aaron Copland Fund for Music, the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation, the Canada Council for the Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the BMI Jazz Composers’ Workshop (Charlie Parker Composition Prize) and SOCAN (Hagood Hardy Award).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Darcy unique as a composer to me especially (and what, I would guess, keeps him in demand) is his use of elements from both the jazz and contemporary classical music traditions in his compositions. Using traditional big band instrumentation (more or less), he&#039;s able to pull new sounds out of the band though the use of minimalism, tone clusters, extended techniques and more…all while ensuring the music is driving and, where appropriate, as swinging as any other great big band.  Check out this track (which is a personal favourite):  chorale, uptempo swing featuring a repeated bass line, extended trumpet solo (here played by Dave Smith, a musician I admired when he lived in Toronto 20 or so years ago)...there&#039;s lots to hear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/oK_2xrvUckU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course a composer and conductor is nothing without the musicians who help to bring his or her ideas to life, and Darcy has assembled an outstanding cast.  They are some of the top musicians on the New York jazz scene, most of whom have earned high acclaim in their careers as leaders and side musicians with other projects. The music may hold all of the instructions - what buttons to push, how loud to play notes, that sort of thing - it&#039;s up to the musicians to bring the music off the page, to find the nuance in the writing, to make the music vibrant. These musicians take Darcy and his music very seriously and this commitment is reflected in their consistently high caliber playing.  Here&#039;s another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/2tVyoBf1eTI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For their Toronto performance, Darcy James Argue&#039;s Secret Society will be performing &lt;i&gt;Brooklyn Babylon&lt;/i&gt; in its entirety. According to the band&#039;s bio, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Brooklyn Babylon&lt;/i&gt; tells the tale of Lev Bezdomni, a carpenter in a future Brooklyn, who is tasked with building the carousel that will crown the tallest tower in the world.&quot; The full production of the work involves live painting and projection; the Toronto show will just be the music.  However, this is not a compromise - &lt;i&gt;Brooklyn Babylon&lt;/i&gt; is some of the best, most exciting big band writing I&#039;ve heard. (And don&#039;t just take my word for it - the album earned JUNO and Grammy Award nominations.) It draws from musical styles and influences too numerous to list; it is incredibly evocative - we hear the sounds of the futuristic Brooklyn, the trials and tribulations of its citizens; and it is brilliantly scored, with the usual instrumentation enhanced by contrabass clarinet, acoustic steel-string guitar, tuba, euphonium and more. Here&#039;s a taste - check out where this goes musically!&lt;/p&gt;

Darcy James Argue&#039;s Secret Society performs &lt;i&gt;Brooklyn Babylon&lt;/i&gt; on Sunday, June 22, 8 pm at The Music Gallery.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91B464AB8B&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, more information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/darcy-james-argues-secret-society-0&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The emphasis in the band has been the orchestration and arrangement of some of the wealth of material emerging from the contemporary composers of Brazil, including such major talents as Egberto Gismonti, Milton Nascimento, Hermeto Pascoal, Jovino Santos Neto and Itibere Zwarg. This is not your father&#039;s big band. Although Gary is steeped in the big band tradition and sound, PanAmericana! represents an attempt to expand, through orchestration, his rhythmic, melodic and harmonic ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What the heck is the Coltrane Ballads project?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/what-heck-coltrane-ballads-project</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toronto will be host to a unique show when Daniel Jamieson presents his Coltrane Ballads project this Monday, September 30 at the Al Green Theatre.  I asked Daniel to tell me more about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - Tell me about the Coltrane Ballads project - what does it look like, and how did it come about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - I came up with the idea for the Coltrane Ballads project in the spring of 2012. I had just returned from the Metropole Orchestra&#039;s Arrangers Workshop where I had the chance to work with Vince Mendoza and Kurt Elling. It was one of the best weeks of my life. I came back incredibly inspired and eager to continue writing for Orchestra. So I tried to think of an interesting project that would allow me this creative outlet. That is when I realized John Coltrane&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Ballads&lt;/i&gt; album was going to be in its 50th year. I spent a lot of time listening to the CD and decided to design a 50th anniversary concert. I then contacted Victor Cheng, who has led his own classical orchestra, the Sneak Peek Orchestra, for a few years. I proposed that we combine my big band (the Danjam Orchestra) with his Sneak Peek Orchestra. Victor was thrilled with the idea and we both agreed that saxophonist Mike Ruby would be a fantastic soloist. When the Metropole found out about the project, they asked if I would conduct a performance of the new &lt;i&gt;Ballads&lt;/i&gt; arrangements with Joe Lovano as the soloist. So I spent the better part of last year arranging the 8 iconic tunes from the record for this hybrid orchestra. The Metropole performance took place last May in Amsterdam. The house was packed and the orchestra was at its best! I was very proud of the work we did that week. Working with Joe Lovano and John Riley (drums) was a treat. Some incredible memories!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - Tell me a bit about the Metropole Orkest - what makes them unique?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - The Metropole is the only orchestra of its kind in the world. It is a hybrid ensemble made up of traditional big band instrumentation plus strings, winds, percussion and harp. They are not a classical orchestra. The Metropole specializes in jazz, pop, and film music. This band can swing and groove like no other. There is simply no other orchestra that can compare! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - As you mention above, your experience with the Metropole goes beyond being a fan - you&#039;ve had the opportunity to work with them and their conductor Vince Mendoza.  Tell us about your interactions with the Metropole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - I am fortunate to have been asked to write for them frequently and I have just been booked to conduct them at the Edison Jazz &amp;amp; World Music Awards this November. I look forward to working with them for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - How did you approach the Coltrane Ballads project - what separates it from other tributes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - My goal was to create a fresh take on the music. There are certainly elements from the original CD that creep their way in to the music; I like to think that the spirit of the original CD inspired my arrangements. A particular challenge is that the concert features a lot of ballads in a row! An obvious statement, perhaps, given the material…but it is an important factor to keep in mind when programming a concert. As I said to the audience in Amsterdam:  I think it helps to think of it as 1 piece with 8 movements - the pieces were designed to work together to create an overall musical message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - The project has been performed once before; what will be special about this Monday&#039;s performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - It was amazing performing the music in Amsterdam but it will really mean something to me to perform it here in Toronto - my home - in the presence of friends, family and peers. I have known Mike Ruby since we were kids - he is a good friend and is tremendously talented; John Riley will be joining us from New York to play drums. John is likely best known for his work with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra; I think he&#039;s simply the best in the world. Arlia de Ruiter will be joining us on violin from Amsterdam - she is the concert master of the Metropole and she will be our concert master for the evening; all of our string players are very excited to work with her. And Victor Cheng is graciously letting me take the conductor&#039;s chair while he covers the piano part. It is sure to be a night to remember! We are hoping a combined concert becomes a yearly tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - To get a taste of the big band/orchestra hybrid, let&#039;s go back to the Metropole.  If you had to pick one Metropole performance to recommend, which would it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - Here is one of my favourite recordings of the Metropole - performing Vince Mendoza&#039;s composition &quot;Otono&quot;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/s2SDNXHUZtk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Coltrane Ballads project takes place this Monday, September 30, 8 pm at the Al Green Theatre (750 Spadina Avenue, in the Miles Nadal Jewish Community Centre).  Tickets and information are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://danjam.ca/coltrane-ballads-in-toronto/&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;danjam.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Scottish National Jazz Orchestra</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/scottish-national-jazz-orchestra</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tsyjo.com/snjo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.tsyjo.com/snjo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/snjo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formed in 1995, under the tirelessly committed and confident direction of saxophonist Tommy Smith, SNJO has developed into a world class ensemble capable of playing the classic big band music of Ellington, Basie, Goodman, Kenton and Herman with tremendous style and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrations of jazz masters from Mingus, Monk, Miles and Coltrane through to Wayne Shorter, Oliver Nelson, Chick Corea, Ray Charles and Pat Metheny have underlined the orchestra’s ease of mobility across the broader jazz canon. And commissioning and creating bold and ambitious new work such as the visionary English composer Keith Tippett’s Autumn and Smith’s own World of the Gods, the world’s first collaboration between jazz big band and Japanese taiko drumming, have confirmed SNJO’s determination to continue jazz’s spirit of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith’s re-orchestration of Rhapsody in Blue took George Gershwin’s Jazz Age concerto on a previously unimagined twenty-first century adventure, providing a platform for the irrepressible Scottish pianist Brian Kellock’s flamboyant skills and unleashing the fiery individual creativity that comes as standard in a SNJO performance. It has since been followed on CD by Smith’s own composition Torah, originally written for Joe Lovano but featuring Smith in a tour de force of saxophone expression within an orchestral framework of outstanding quality and vigour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The many internationally regarded musicians and composers with whom SNJO has worked have endorsed The Times’ assessment. Vibes virtuoso Gary Burton, Sir John Dankworth and Dame Cleo Laine, top American saxophonists Joe Lovano, David Liebman and Bobby Watson, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, drummer Gary Novak, and guest directors including the Gil Evans of our times, Maria Schneider, German composer Florian Ross and American pianist Geoffrey Keezer have all heaped praise upon the orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Scottish national jazz orchestra was mooted and indeed might have been possible long before SNJO came into being. Since the music’s early days Scotland has been producing jazz musicians capable of working in refined circles but forced by economic realities to move beyond Scotland. In 1938, a young trombonist from Glasgow called George Chisholm recorded with Fats Waller and unwittingly began a supply line that has continued unabated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Chisholm’s bandmate, Ayrshire-born trumpeter Tommy McQuater, who worked with Benny Carter shortly after Chisholm’s experience with Waller, through to Fife-born Joe Temperley, who currently occupies the baritone saxophone chair in Wynton Marsalis’s renowned Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, having previously worked with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman and Buddy Rich, Scots have made their mark in jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommy Smith himself had joined the exodus that had also included trumpeter Jimmy Deuchar, saxophonists Bobby Wellins and Tommy Whittle and guitarist Jim Mullen when he went to study at Boston’s prestigious Berklee School of Music as a teenager and wound up touring the world as a member of Gary Burton’s group.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Jim Galloway And His Wee Big Band</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/jim-galloway-and-his-wee-big-band</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jimgallowayjazz.blogspot.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://jimgallowayjazz.blogspot.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/jimgalloway250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1979, Jim Galloway introduced his 17-piece Wee Big Band as a repertory band specializing in the music of the great bands of the swing era. Today reputed to have the most extensive repertoire of any big band in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim has toured as leader of several groups, carving a niche for himself through his extremely personal tone on saxophone, and his warm lyrical approach to playing. He has also recorded albums in Austria, England, Canada, Holland, South Africa, including ten for Canada’s Sackville label, with Buddy Tate, Jay McShann, Don Thompson, Ed Bichert, Neil Swainson, among others. Galloway has performed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington in 1991 and in 1993, he was the subject of a half hour CBC television profile about his life and music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Jim plays alto, tenor and baritone, his main love is the curved soprano. Regarding his style of playing and his choice of music, he thinks that for a while there seemed to be a whole school of thought that said &quot;if I play recognizable melodies I’m not in the game.&quot; Jim thinks this is changing, which is nice and inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent swing soprano player with a lighter tone than Sidney Bechet, Jim Galloway has made many recordings with like-minded veterans. He played locally in Scotland on clarinet and alto before emigrating to Canada in 1965. He soon began specializing on soprano, led the Metro Stompers (1968), put together the Wee Big Band (1978), and hosted the weekly jazz radio program Toronto Alive! (1981-1987). Galloway, who has appeared at many jazz festivals and jazz parties, has recorded for Sackville, Hep, and Music &amp;amp; Arts along with several smaller Canadian labels with such pianists as Dick Wellstood, Art Hodes, and most often with Jay McShann.&lt;/p&gt;

That&#039;s what keeps him coming back to the jazz venues again and again. Nor is Andy a jazz singer, despite its influence on his career. He&#039;s just a crooner who loves the standards of Great American Songbook.&lt;/p&gt;

They deliver a veritable gumbo of wild gypsy, old-jazz, klezmer, and folk music always performed with a good-time New Orleans spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an ever expanding repertoire of new quirky original tunes and fun favourites (everything from high-and-lonesome country hits to obscure 1930s Dixieland numbers), they perform regularly around town anywhere good music is found! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their novel old-time street band instrumentation also lends itself naturally to performances outside the typical concert venue; The St. Lawrence Market for example where they’ve become favourite buskers among market regulars, or street and community festivals where The Boxcar Boys are often found parading around. When the audience erupts in dance The Boxcar Boys often step off stage and join in on the fun without missing a beat! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a never-waning sense of humour and excitement, The Boxcar Boys bring a keen spirit of improvisation to their music ensuring that no two performances are ever the same.&lt;/p&gt;
