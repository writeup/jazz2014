 <title>What&#039;s so good about Darcy James Argue?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-darcy-james-argue</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/darcy-james-argues-secret-society&quot;&gt;Darcy James Argue&amp;#039;s Secret Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay - full disclosure.  I run a big band, which means I&#039;m predisposed to liking big bands.  And I&#039;ve played one of Darcy&#039;s charts, which means I&#039;m predisposed to liking his music.  And I&#039;ve seen the Secret Society several times, which means I&#039;m predisposed to liking the band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of that should matter because regardless of predispositions or biases, it&#039;s all fantastic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can sometimes be the case, separating out the band leader from the band is tricky.  The Secret Society is Darcy&#039;s instrument; big band is his main performance outlet.  But he has made a name for himself as an outstanding composer for ensembles of all sizes: in addition to performances and commissions with big bands in North America, Europe and Australia, he has composed for chamber duo and string quartet, art songs, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.  He&#039;s earned awards, grants and fellowships from New Music USA, the Aaron Copland Fund for Music, the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation, the Canada Council for the Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the BMI Jazz Composers’ Workshop (Charlie Parker Composition Prize) and SOCAN (Hagood Hardy Award).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Darcy unique as a composer to me especially (and what, I would guess, keeps him in demand) is his use of elements from both the jazz and contemporary classical music traditions in his compositions. Using traditional big band instrumentation (more or less), he&#039;s able to pull new sounds out of the band though the use of minimalism, tone clusters, extended techniques and more…all while ensuring the music is driving and, where appropriate, as swinging as any other great big band.  Check out this track (which is a personal favourite):  chorale, uptempo swing featuring a repeated bass line, extended trumpet solo (here played by Dave Smith, a musician I admired when he lived in Toronto 20 or so years ago)...there&#039;s lots to hear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/oK_2xrvUckU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course a composer and conductor is nothing without the musicians who help to bring his or her ideas to life, and Darcy has assembled an outstanding cast.  They are some of the top musicians on the New York jazz scene, most of whom have earned high acclaim in their careers as leaders and side musicians with other projects. The music may hold all of the instructions - what buttons to push, how loud to play notes, that sort of thing - it&#039;s up to the musicians to bring the music off the page, to find the nuance in the writing, to make the music vibrant. These musicians take Darcy and his music very seriously and this commitment is reflected in their consistently high caliber playing.  Here&#039;s another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/2tVyoBf1eTI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For their Toronto performance, Darcy James Argue&#039;s Secret Society will be performing &lt;i&gt;Brooklyn Babylon&lt;/i&gt; in its entirety. According to the band&#039;s bio, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Brooklyn Babylon&lt;/i&gt; tells the tale of Lev Bezdomni, a carpenter in a future Brooklyn, who is tasked with building the carousel that will crown the tallest tower in the world.&quot; The full production of the work involves live painting and projection; the Toronto show will just be the music.  However, this is not a compromise - &lt;i&gt;Brooklyn Babylon&lt;/i&gt; is some of the best, most exciting big band writing I&#039;ve heard. (And don&#039;t just take my word for it - the album earned JUNO and Grammy Award nominations.) It draws from musical styles and influences too numerous to list; it is incredibly evocative - we hear the sounds of the futuristic Brooklyn, the trials and tribulations of its citizens; and it is brilliantly scored, with the usual instrumentation enhanced by contrabass clarinet, acoustic steel-string guitar, tuba, euphonium and more. Here&#039;s a taste - check out where this goes musically!&lt;/p&gt;

Darcy James Argue&#039;s Secret Society performs &lt;i&gt;Brooklyn Babylon&lt;/i&gt; on Sunday, June 22, 8 pm at The Music Gallery.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91B464AB8B&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, more information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/darcy-james-argues-secret-society-0&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Lettuce?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-lettuce</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/lettuce&quot;&gt;Lettuce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I took acting classes in high school (stay with me - I&#039;ll make it all connect), our teacher taught us that there is acting, and there is acting &lt;i&gt;at&lt;/i&gt; something.  If someone is truly acting, the audience believes the actor is actually another character.  If someone is acting &lt;i&gt;at&lt;/i&gt; something, the audience can tell that they&#039;re watching an actor onstage pretending to be someone else.  Similarly, in music, there&#039;s a big difference between bands which pretend to play in a certain style and bands who know a certain style inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lettuce is the real deal.  Their brand of 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s funk and soul is almost indistinguishable from the music which made funk and soul so popular when it took the world by storm 50 years ago.  They groove, they&#039;re tight, they jam, their horns are killer…with Lettuce there is no pretence, no following fads - just 100% pure funky goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They played The Phoenix in February and, not having seen them live, I was sure to be in the audience. I was impressed by their playing, certainly; but I was also amazed by the breadth of the audience:  people of all ages, colours, shapes…there is something about funk and soul music which resonates with music aficionados and casual listeners alike.  Whether they were playing a tune with tight horn lines or stretching out, Lettuce kept the audience enthralled.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/J1IYY2tJMak?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That…just…feels…so…good.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their bio, on their new album &lt;i&gt;Fly&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;the pocket is deeper than ever.&quot; &quot;The pocket&quot; is one of those undefinable things (like &quot;swing&quot;) - I&#039;m not sure how to describe it, but I do know that without &quot;the pocket&quot;, the music just doesn&#039;t quite sit as well.  In my recent &lt;a href=&quot;/artistic-directors-guide-jazz-live-1&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz - Live!&lt;/a&gt; session with Larnell Lewis, he described it this way:  like with a pair of jeans, the pocket holds things.  The deeper the pocket, the more you can hold.  When it comes to Lettuce, having a deep pocket means all the various parts - the horn lines, the grooves, the feel - can all be held in one place.  Of course, it helps to have a guy like Adam Deitch on the drums, laying it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/QJU9cRHydJQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lettuce is currently on the road in support of their new album &lt;i&gt;Fly&lt;/i&gt;. Like many bands with new albums, they&#039;ve created a teaser trailer.  But unlike most other bands, the trailer has no words - not even any on-screen text.  They let the music speak for itself.  Which, to me, speaks volumes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/EgbhKcETmjE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lettuce performs on a double-bill with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band on Wednesday June 25, 8 pm on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C90F7D5CFAD&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/dirty-dozen-brass-band-lettuce&quot;&gt;visit the concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Yoshihiro Murakawa Quartet</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/yoshihiro-murakawa-quartet</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/photo%20-%20yoshihio%20murakawa%20quartet%20for%20web.jpg&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performing as part of the Youth Jazz Showcase - June 28 11am-2pm at the Toronto Star Stage&lt;br /&gt;
Yoshihiro Murakawa (saxophone) was born in Sapporo, Hokkaido, on May 13 1985. He grew up with parents who were both brass musicians and studied classical piano from early childhood. In his elementary, middle and high school he performed as guitarist and drummer with various rock bands, developing his musical technique and stage skills. By the time he attended Hokkaido University, he was ready to join the University jazz workshop at the same time studying in the Faculty of Engineering. He became interested in the alto sax and his musical life really took off performing in jazz cafes and special event appearances; he became proficient in various musical styles including bebop, fusion, free jazz and latin jazz and formed friendships with jazz musicians from at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating from The Hokkaido University Institute of Technology, Yashihiro began to play on a regular basis with the latin jazz pianist Ichikawa Yoshihiro and continued to perform on a regular basis at various concerts and events and also in studio gigs for film animation and video games. He is a frequent performer at the Sapporo International Jazz Festival; in 2013 he won the Sapporo City Jazz Park live jazz contest Grand Prix with his ensemble the Yoshihiro Murakawa Quartet, out of more than 150 contestants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoshihoro attempts to stretch the spectrum of saxophone performance whether playing soprano, alto, tenor or baritone saxophone. His influences include Charlie Parker, Paul Desmond, Art Pepper, Cannonball Adderley, Phil Woods, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Branford Marsalis, Pat Metheny and many others in various musical genres including Chopin, Liszt, Paquito d’Rivera, Earth Wind &amp;amp; Fire, The Yellow Monkey, MISIA, Masayoshi Yamazaki and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yoshihiro Murakawa Quartet also features Kimura Yu (piano), Ito Mio (bass) and Mima Daisuke (drums).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What the heck is the Coltrane Ballads project?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/what-heck-coltrane-ballads-project</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toronto will be host to a unique show when Daniel Jamieson presents his Coltrane Ballads project this Monday, September 30 at the Al Green Theatre.  I asked Daniel to tell me more about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - Tell me about the Coltrane Ballads project - what does it look like, and how did it come about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - I came up with the idea for the Coltrane Ballads project in the spring of 2012. I had just returned from the Metropole Orchestra&#039;s Arrangers Workshop where I had the chance to work with Vince Mendoza and Kurt Elling. It was one of the best weeks of my life. I came back incredibly inspired and eager to continue writing for Orchestra. So I tried to think of an interesting project that would allow me this creative outlet. That is when I realized John Coltrane&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Ballads&lt;/i&gt; album was going to be in its 50th year. I spent a lot of time listening to the CD and decided to design a 50th anniversary concert. I then contacted Victor Cheng, who has led his own classical orchestra, the Sneak Peek Orchestra, for a few years. I proposed that we combine my big band (the Danjam Orchestra) with his Sneak Peek Orchestra. Victor was thrilled with the idea and we both agreed that saxophonist Mike Ruby would be a fantastic soloist. When the Metropole found out about the project, they asked if I would conduct a performance of the new &lt;i&gt;Ballads&lt;/i&gt; arrangements with Joe Lovano as the soloist. So I spent the better part of last year arranging the 8 iconic tunes from the record for this hybrid orchestra. The Metropole performance took place last May in Amsterdam. The house was packed and the orchestra was at its best! I was very proud of the work we did that week. Working with Joe Lovano and John Riley (drums) was a treat. Some incredible memories!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - Tell me a bit about the Metropole Orkest - what makes them unique?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - The Metropole is the only orchestra of its kind in the world. It is a hybrid ensemble made up of traditional big band instrumentation plus strings, winds, percussion and harp. They are not a classical orchestra. The Metropole specializes in jazz, pop, and film music. This band can swing and groove like no other. There is simply no other orchestra that can compare! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - As you mention above, your experience with the Metropole goes beyond being a fan - you&#039;ve had the opportunity to work with them and their conductor Vince Mendoza.  Tell us about your interactions with the Metropole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - I am fortunate to have been asked to write for them frequently and I have just been booked to conduct them at the Edison Jazz &amp;amp; World Music Awards this November. I look forward to working with them for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - How did you approach the Coltrane Ballads project - what separates it from other tributes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - My goal was to create a fresh take on the music. There are certainly elements from the original CD that creep their way in to the music; I like to think that the spirit of the original CD inspired my arrangements. A particular challenge is that the concert features a lot of ballads in a row! An obvious statement, perhaps, given the material…but it is an important factor to keep in mind when programming a concert. As I said to the audience in Amsterdam:  I think it helps to think of it as 1 piece with 8 movements - the pieces were designed to work together to create an overall musical message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - The project has been performed once before; what will be special about this Monday&#039;s performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - It was amazing performing the music in Amsterdam but it will really mean something to me to perform it here in Toronto - my home - in the presence of friends, family and peers. I have known Mike Ruby since we were kids - he is a good friend and is tremendously talented; John Riley will be joining us from New York to play drums. John is likely best known for his work with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra; I think he&#039;s simply the best in the world. Arlia de Ruiter will be joining us on violin from Amsterdam - she is the concert master of the Metropole and she will be our concert master for the evening; all of our string players are very excited to work with her. And Victor Cheng is graciously letting me take the conductor&#039;s chair while he covers the piano part. It is sure to be a night to remember! We are hoping a combined concert becomes a yearly tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - To get a taste of the big band/orchestra hybrid, let&#039;s go back to the Metropole.  If you had to pick one Metropole performance to recommend, which would it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - Here is one of my favourite recordings of the Metropole - performing Vince Mendoza&#039;s composition &quot;Otono&quot;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/s2SDNXHUZtk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Coltrane Ballads project takes place this Monday, September 30, 8 pm at the Al Green Theatre (750 Spadina Avenue, in the Miles Nadal Jewish Community Centre).  Tickets and information are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://danjam.ca/coltrane-ballads-in-toronto/&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;danjam.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about David Sanborn, Bob James and Steve Gadd?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-david-sanborn-bob-james-and-steve-gadd</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/david-sanborn&quot;&gt;David Sanborn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start here, from the collective&#039;s bio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first creative collaboration between keyboardist-composer-arranger Bob James and alto saxophonist David Sanborn, a quarter century ago, was the million-selling GRAMMY Award-winning album &lt;i&gt;Double Vision&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too shabby.  So how do you follow up on an album like that, 25 years later?  Start with a saxophonist with a distinctive sound and fantastic technique, add a pianist comfortable playing in almost any style of music, throw in a drummer whose pocket is a mile wide and a mile deep, and round it off with a bass player who has played with many of the biggest names in jazz.  Oh - and maybe even have the album make a musical nod to the late Dave Brubeck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sanborn and James, the new album - called &lt;i&gt;Quartette Humaine&lt;/i&gt; - is not simply a repeat of &lt;i&gt;Double Vision&lt;/i&gt;.  Instead of synths and smooth jazz, we hear an acoustic quartet which swings with great melody and soloing.  There are no bells and whistles on the new album, and we get to hear elements of what has made each musician so successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, what sticks out about David Sanborn is his sound.  My older brother played tenor saxophone throughout his junior and high school career, and his David Sanborn tapes were frequently in the stereo.  Even then - before I knew that jazz had additional labels like &quot;swing&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot; - I remember the sound coming out of the speakers:  direct, clear, gorgeous.  His sound remains; I now also have an appreciation for his technique and range - he&#039;s just as comfortable playing with Stevie Wonder as he is with Jack DeJohnette.  Here&#039;s what I mean - a track from the new album:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/e33TwXmK-CA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It&#039;s Bob James&#039; range which is most impressive to me.  He&#039;s recognized as one of the creators of smooth jazz, but he&#039;s also written soundtracks for movies and TV (including the theme song for &lt;i&gt;Taxi&lt;/i&gt;), recorded straight-up classical albums and solo piano albums, and played with some of the biggest names in pop.  What&#039;s more, he&#039;s one of the most often-sampled musicians in hip-hop.  Here&#039;s Bob performing &quot;Nautilus&quot; live - check out this groove:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/35377398&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of Steve Gadd, Chick Corea is reported to have said, &quot;Every drummer wants to play like Gadd because he plays perfect.&quot;  I&#039;m not sure how to expand on that.  Steve Gadd has played with every major musician in the jazz, smooth jazz and pop worlds, and is widely credited with being one of the most influential drummers of all time.  If you&#039;ve read my other posts, you know that for me, groove rules.  Whether it&#039;s swing, funk, hip-hop, pop…it&#039;s got to groove.  And Steve Gadd is all about groove.  You might recognize this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/RTiyLuZOs1A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Rounding out the group is bassist Scott Colley, who was touring with Carmen McRae before even finishing his undergraduate degree, and whose list of musical colleagues includes Dizzy Gillespie, Joe Henderson, Pat Metheny, Michael Brecker, Andrew Hill, Donny McCaslin and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Sanborn, Bob James, Steve Gadd and Scott Colley take to the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Mainstage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square on Tuesday, June 25 at 8 pm.

 <title>Jaron Freeman-Fox and the Opposite of Everything</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoppositeofeverything.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.theoppositeofeverything.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/JFF%26theOOE-2-web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described as “Gogol Bordello meets The Mothers of Invention”, or “Tom Waits playing the fiddle while fronting The Mahavishnu Orchestra” Jaron Freeman-Fox &amp;amp; The Opposite of Everything somehow combine bluegrass with Indian music, afro-beat with sea shanties, or klezmer with the blues, and make it sound like the most natural thing in the world. With a diverse cast of Toronto’s finest and most adventurous musicians, the band has toured the country coast to coast, and showcased their highly original music at festivals as diverse as The Ottawa Jazz Festival, The Newfoundland Sound Symposium, The Vancouver Folk Festival, and recently at world music expo WOMEX, held this year in Thessaloniki, Greece.  After three years of touring and perfecting their repertoire, the band finally has a new album showcasing the full breadth of their sound, and will be releasing it in February 2013!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fronting the ensemble, Jaron Freeman-Fox dances down the fine line between the beautiful and the ridiculous, while redefining what the violin can do.  Having played on over 40 albums (Jayme Stone, Autorickshaw, Peter Katz) and having toured the world many times over as a side-man with bands such as The David Woodhead Confabulation and Delhi 2 Dublin, Freeman-Fox fuses his roots of Celtic and bluegrass fiddling with his study of Indian classical music and jazz, playing the 5-string violins of his late mentor; fiddle pioneer Oliver Schroer.  In 2010 Jaron released his award-winning instrumental debut album &lt;i&gt;Manic Almanac : Slow Möbius&lt;/i&gt; and formed this fiery band The Opposite of Everything. Since then, Jaron has performed in Brunei, Indonesia, India, throughout the US, UK, Europe and at festivals across Canada, for crowds of over 100,000, royalty, and audiences dressed as wizards. (True story!)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Who, exactly, is Kneebody?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/who-exactly-kneebody</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/kneebody&quot;&gt;Kneebody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Kneebody&#039;s website, the bio for the Grammy-nominated, jazz-rock quintet is understandably vague:  trying to summarize their music in one neat sentence (or paragraph) is no easy task.  What I can tell you, is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They released their first album in 2005 on Dave Douglas&#039; Greenleaf Music label&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their 2009 release, with Theo Bleckmann singing music composed and inspired by Charles Ives, earned the group a Grammy nomination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trumpeter Shane Endsley has been named one of the Top 25 trumpeters of his generation by &lt;i&gt;Downbeat Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saxophonist Ben Wendel is an award-winning composer who has performed with, among others, Ignacio Berroa, Tigran Hamasyan and Snoop Dogg (yes, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Snoop Dogg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pianist Adam Benjamin has twice been named a rising star in &lt;i&gt;Downbeat Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, has toured with Dave Douglas, Joshua Redman and Beck, and has written scores for a variety of films&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bassist Kaveh Rastegar has played with musicians ranging from Nels Cline to Antibalas to Cee Lo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drummer Nate Wood is an accomplished multi-instrumentalist - on his first solo album he composes, sings, engineers and plays all the instruments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ensemble of musicians with such an eclectic combination of tastes and experiences perhaps logically produces a diverse mix of music.  Here&#039;s a teaser from their first release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/j79nOQV3D3w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What strikes me first about Kneebody&#039;s music is that even though there is a lot going on in their compositions, it often sounds simple.  The melody in this tune, for example, is fairly clear; I don&#039;t notice the various changing time signatures or shifting rhythmic patterns - and that&#039;s a good thing.  It&#039;s a compliment to the musicians that they make it sound so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I describe Kneebody&#039;s music in the opening paragraph of this post as &quot;jazz-rock&quot;.  It doesn&#039;t cover the full range of their repertoire, but much of their music features driving, rock-influenced beats, electric instruments (keyboard, bass, and lots of effects for trumpet and sax), and a joyful, rock-like, reckless abandon.  The fusion resonates with me on a basic level - again, it&#039;s not important to know exactly what&#039;s going on in a tune if I&#039;m grooving to the music.  Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/dlspnMAF0Wk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A further compliment to these musicians is the variety of styles in which they play.  They&#039;re not afraid to go a bit &quot;outside&quot; or try something different.  Their 2009, Grammy-nominated album, featuring Theo Bleckmann, is a great example:  with Theo on vocals, they tackle music written and inspired by Charles Ives to great effect.  These are not jazz standards by any stretch and they truly make them their own.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/xZA1V-6Uihw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whether your tastes are &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;far out&quot;, Kneebody will rock your socks.  When they take the stage, you can count on pure energy and intensity from the first note to the last.  They represent an exciting trend in jazz:  great musicians, great music, and an interesting fusion of styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kneebody performs at &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/rivoli&quot;&gt;The Rivoli&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, June 29 at 10 pm.  For complete information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/kneebody&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
