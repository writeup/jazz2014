 <title>What&#039;s so good about Bobby McFerrin</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-bobby-mcferrin</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/bobby-mcferrin-spirityouall&quot;&gt;Bobby McFerrin - spirityouall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I&#039;m supposed to go &quot;beyond the bio&quot; with these posts, but here&#039;s a line from Bobby McFerrin&#039;s bio which I think captures what makes him so special as an artist:  &quot;The 10-time Grammy winner has blurred the distinction between pop music and fine art, goofing around barefoot in the world’s finest concert halls, exploring uncharted vocal territory, inspiring a whole new generation of a cappella singers and the beatbox movement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with a musical master, a concert by Bobby McFerrin is so much more that just a concert - it&#039;s an experience. The instrument on display is certainly impressive - whether alone on stage or accompanied by a full orchestra, what he&#039;s able to do with his unique, multi-octave voice, beatboxing and body percussion is unmatched and enthralling. But for me, it&#039;s the rest of the package - the joy which emanates from the stage when he sings; the way in which he engages the audience - both through his stage persona and literally via audience participation - which makes Bobby McFerrin a must-see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than have me try to explain Bobby&#039;s approach to singing, check out this clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/81uJZIF9TCs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The clip above demonstrates Bobby&#039;s immense talent as a performer, but also  his commitment to sharing the joy of singing, and his passion for education.  It&#039;s apt that the video was taken on a day called Sing! Day of Song, in front of 60,000 other singers.  In his own words:  &quot;I try to sing the way I sing in my kitchen, because I just can’t help myself. I want audiences to leave the theatre and sing in their own kitchens the next morning. I want to bring audiences into the incredible feeling of joy and freedom I get when I sing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite videos of Bobby McFerrin I saw thanks to Facebook - someone posted it on their page.  It&#039;s not often that I include a video from the World Science Festival in the Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz…but I think you&#039;ll see why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ne6tB2KiZuk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a previous life, I managed a children&#039;s choir, and the Artistic Director always used to say &quot;If you can talk, you can sing.&quot; I feel Bobby McFerrin is always trying to remind us of the same idea.  We&#039;re not going to be able to do what he does, but we can share in the joy which he gets from singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his 2014 TD Toronto Jazz Festival appearance, he&#039;ll be performing music from his spirityouall project, in which he &quot;re-imagines Americana with beloved spirituals and original songs, raising the roof with joyful grooves.&quot; He&#039;ll have a full band with him on stage, but his voice will be on full display.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/eiEUaYd2MEg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I can&#039;t wait.  Bobby McFerrin - spirityouall performs Friday, June 27, 8 pm on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square.

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Dianne Reeves?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-dianne-reeves</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/dianne-reeves&quot;&gt;Dianne Reeves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some artists, determining the focus of an AD&#039;s Guide entry is easy - one quality or focus stands out from the rest.  With an artist like Dianne Reeves, though, I&#039;m not sure where to start - I find her intriguing on so many levels:  her instrument, her approach to improvisation, the way she engages with the audience…she is an excellent example of the elusive &quot;complete package.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#039;t remember exactly where I first heard Dianne Reeves - it&#039;s possible that it was on the radio, perhaps a track from her recording &lt;i&gt;The Calling&lt;/i&gt;, celebrating the music of Sarah Vaughan.  As a big band leader, I was intrigued by the arrangements; but her voice drew me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it, exactly, about Dianne Reeves which intrigues me?  First, it&#039;s her instrument. As I&#039;ve mentioned in previous posts, it&#039;s silly perhaps to say &quot;this singer has a great voice&quot;…but with Dianne it holds true.  Hers is rich, full of colour and nuance - I feel I could listen to it all day.  Next it&#039;s her interpretation of melodies - she doesn&#039;t need to do much; with a subtle shift in rhythm here, a held note there, she makes each tune her own, whether a jazz standard or something more contemporary.  Then there&#039;s her approach to improvisation - Dianne never really gets flashy; she concentrates on quality over quality, ensuring her note choice is always tasty and satisfying.  Enough talk - here&#039;s a sample which demonstrates all of the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/84105061&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So - great voice, great interpretation, tasty improvisation…anything else?  Well, yes - Dianne Reeves is incredibly engaging, both on and off stage. The way she sings invites the audience in - from her first note to her last, the audience feels welcomed, and she radiates a joy from the stage. I had the pleasure of helping to produce a Dianne Reeves concert several years ago, and can confirm that she&#039;s just as welcoming behind the scenes - on the drive back to the hotel, she happily chatted about watching curling on the hotel television. No pretense, no attitude; instead the revelry about life in general which comes across in her singing. Here&#039;s a clip of a beautiful ballad, performed only with two guitars, which keeps the audience enraptured from beginning to end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/80445455&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For her new album, &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Life&lt;/i&gt;, Dianne has chosen songs which, according to her bio, &quot;have touched [my] spirit in different ways.&quot; Although the songs span a variety of styles - swing, R&amp;amp;B, soul, reggae - each has undeniably been made her own. In my mind, that is the mark of a true artist.  (You can see a short promo video about the new album &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/47YiHkWjWCg&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianne Reeves performs Tuesday, June 24 at 8 pm on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://torontojazz.com/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square.  Joining her on stage will be Romero Lubambo (guitar), Reginald Veal (bass) and Terreon Gully (drums); the Brandi Disterheft Quartet opens up.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C90EF0CCA53&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit her &lt;a href=&quot;http://torontojazz.com/concert/dianne-reeves&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

With his distinctive sound, and contemporary sensibility, he delivers fresh, swinging, and dynamic new interpretations of timeless classics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheridan&#039;s eclectic and expansive repertoire includes jazz and pop standards, swing, bossas, urban blues, rarely-heard musical treasures, and his own original compositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consummate singer and entertainer has worked with many of North America&#039;s top jazz musicians, captivating standing-room-only audiences at premier jazz venues. Joel Sheridan is celebrating his 6th consecutive year performing at the TD Toronto Jazz Festival, and his highly-anticipated debut CD will be released this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Carmen Souza?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-carmen-souza</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/carmen-souza&quot;&gt;Carmen Souza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound a bit odd to say &quot;a good singer has to have a good voice&quot;.  But, without getting too much into critiques of certain singers and styles of music (how much time do you have?), ultimately, it&#039;s true:  a good singer is set apart by his or her voice, and how that voice is used.  Carmen Souza not only has a great voice, but an interesting one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delving into the music of Carmen Souza requires a bit of delving into the history of her home country, Cape Verde.  Located in the Atlantic Ocean about 500 kilometres west of Senegal, Cape Verde was colonized in the 15th century by the Portuguese.  It was ideally situated as a stopping point between Europe and the Americas (including, in a less ideal part of its history, the slave trade) and as a result influences from a varieties of cultures are evident in everything from the languages spoken to the music to the food:  Portuguese, Caribbean, African and Brazilian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmen Souza&#039;s music very much demonstrates this wide variety of influences.  As a young woman she spoke both Creole and Portuguese, and sang in a professional gospel choir.  Then, when Portuguese producer and bass player Theo Pas&#039;cal heard her early in her performing career, he introduced her to jazz.  Ever since, her music has been a fantastic mix of genres - I can hear Brazilian samba and bossa, straight ahead jazz, Afro-Cuban rhythms, and more.  Here&#039;s a track which demonstrates the instrument at the root of Carmen&#039;s music - a beautiful voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;451&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/nuObfuBWkik?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The mix of styles which have influenced Carmen is intriguing on its own, and means that one can never totally know what to expect - one minute she could be singing a mellow bossa, and the next singing &quot;Donna Lee&quot;.  But what especially intrigues me about Carmen Souza is the way she &lt;i&gt;uses&lt;/i&gt; her voice.  The clip above shows off a deep, rich voice; she also sings to great effect with a higher, more nasal sound.  Her technique is also impressive - I wasn&#039;t kidding about &quot;Donna Lee&quot;!  She can move around as nimbly as a great instrumentalist.  Here&#039;s a longer compilation video which shows off a variety of Carmen&#039;s styles and techniques (check out the bit at 2:05!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/K4AJWZ9Gsf0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Carmen&#039;s most recent album, &lt;i&gt;Kachupada&lt;/i&gt;, is named, appropriately enough, after a West African stew that blends a variety of ingredients.  Her music is much the same.  She was asked, for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2013/6/Carmen-Souzas-Kachupada-album-stream-and-QA&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;CBC blog&lt;/a&gt;, about her various musical influences, and she said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They are so natural that I don&#039;t really think too much about them, it&#039;s almost as if it was other native languages that I speak. Music is about communication, and you express yourself in the language that is familiar to you. So when I&#039;m composing I just express whatever comes from the inspired moment and then I play with these ideas together with the lyric and the message that I want to send out. And that&#039;s how music flows.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a short video about the new album in which Carmen discusses at greater length - and passionately - her various influences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/i3-RRVkK01A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;

She discovered Jazz for the first time at the age of six while shuffling through her dad’s CD collection, and began singing along to the music of Doris Day, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.&lt;br /&gt;
Barbra has amassed an impressive list of performing credits including collaborations with Dave Young, Peter Appleyard, Joe Sealy and The Brian Barlow Big Band and was named one of Canada&#039;s Top 5 Female Jazz Singers by Tonic host Tim Tamashiro on CBC - Radio 2.&lt;br /&gt;
Barbra&#039;s debut album entitled, “That&#039;s What I Do” was released with a live-to-air concert celebration on Jazz.FM91 hosted by Ross Porter.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2013 Barbra was named the first runner-up for the “Sassy Award” at the Sarah Vaughan Jazz Vocal Competition held at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center as part of the TD James Moody Democracy of Jazz Festival.&lt;br /&gt;
She continues to perform regularly presenting a wide repertoire of both jazz standards and original music. Her thoughts on pursuing a career as a jazz musician: “Nice work if you can get it. And you can get it – if you try.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Nellie McKay?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-nellie-mckay</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/nellie-mckay&quot;&gt;Nellie McKay (solo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many layers to Nellie McKay I&#039;m not sure where to start.  Perhaps I should give the opening lines to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; which, in a review of a film-noir musical biography Nellie created, refers to &quot;McKay’s virtually unlimited gifts as a singer, songwriter, actress, pianist, ukulele player, mimic, satirist and comedian...&quot;  Not a bad place to start, I would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nellie McKay does have some formal post-secondary jazz training in voice - and you can tell when listening to the way she uses her instrument - but most of her training has been in the real world:  she&#039;s won awards and acclaim for her work in theatre and film; her music has been heard on TV and in movies; live TV appearances include almost every major day-time and night-time talk show.  What is is that makes her music so appealing?  Here&#039;s a two-song sample which will explain a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/hU446HDtGv8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So let&#039;s chat about the first tune, &quot;Mother of Pearl&quot;, a McKay orignial.  When I saw this clip, the first thing that I noticed was her voice - crystal clear, a beautiful sound.  As the tune got going, I found myself drawn in by the lyrics (in a &quot;did she really just say that?&quot; kind of way).  And by the end, I was hooked by the simple but catchy composition, the sense of humour on display, and the almost mischievous way in which she presents it.  I feel like there&#039;s almost always something deeper going on in Nellie&#039;s tunes - as if beyond the clean and cheerful exterior there is something cynical at work.  It&#039;s a streak I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nellie&#039;s performance of the second tune in the clip, &quot;If I Had You&quot;, a late-1920&#039;s-era standard, to me clearly indicates what makes her a great musician.  Performing solo is always a challenge; it&#039;s rare to find a vocalist who takes it on.  With her simple ukulele strumming the only accompaniment, Nellie presents a short but moving interpretation of the tune.  Here, there is no extra meaning - just pure music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Nellie McKay takes the stage, you can be assured of great singing, interesting original tunes, and lots of hidden meaning (make sure you listen to the lyrics!). But beyond that, she can be unpredictable - she&#039;s just as likely to be singing a jazz standard as she is a folk, pop or reggae song.  In this three-tune NPR Tiny Desk Concert, she seems just as comfortable singing in the caribbean, country and pop ballad styles:&lt;/p&gt;

Nellie McKay performs the second set on Saturday, June 30 at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt;.  Emerging folk/jazz vocalist &lt;a href=&quot;/artist/becca-stevens&quot;&gt;Becca Stevens&lt;/a&gt; opens up with her trio starting at 10 pm.

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Natalie Cole?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-natalie-cole</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/natalie-cole&quot;&gt;Natalie Cole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie Cole is probably best known in the jazz world for her 1991 release &lt;i&gt;Unforgettable...With Love&lt;/i&gt; on which she created a powerful duet by singing along and interacting with a track of her father&#039;s performance of &quot;Unforgettable&quot;.  The album provided Natalie with a dramatic break from what had been a career based primarily in the R&amp;amp;B world (a world in which she had immense success), earned six Grammy Awards, and sold more than 14 million copies worldwide.  In case you need a refresher, here&#039;s the video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xm9yx?start=4&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xm9yx_natalie-cole-unforgettable_music&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Natalie Cole - Unforgettable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/Zerenodo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zerenodo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie Cole&#039;s father, of course, is pianist and velvet-voiced singer Nat King Cole.  But Natalie is so much more than just her father&#039;s daughter.  She released hit after hit in the 1970s, and continued with acclaimed releases in the 1980s and 1990s.  As I always say, when it comes to singers, for me it starts with the voice...and Natalie has a powerful instrument.  But the voice is just a starting point - what truly distinguishes Natalie as an outstanding vocalist is how she uses her voice:  the passion with which she sings, the way she interprets melodies.  In this clip, I&#039;m entranced from her first note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/KGFcDTmLUH8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Taking on a tune like &quot;Smile&quot; - a true classic which has been oft-covered -  is brave, even for a veteran like Natalie Cole.  But in this performance she makes the tune unequivocally hers - it&#039;s her phrasing, her embellishments - and I&#039;m knocked out by the poise and passion with which she sings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond her musical presence, I&#039;m fascinated by Natalie Cole&#039;s story.  She doesn&#039;t hide her past drug use, her illness (Hepatitis C) and the kidney transplant she needed in order to survive.  In fact, in 2010 she released her memoir, called &lt;i&gt;Love Brought Me Back&lt;/i&gt;, which tells of the highs and lows of her career.  I often wonder whether the lows experienced by an artist - even if self-inflicted - enhance that artist&#039;s output; Natalie seems to refer to this query in a roundabout way in this clip, in which she talks about the 2008 release &lt;i&gt;Still Unforgettable&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/IfeMWSNtJiI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Natalie Cole is an outstanding artist who has had quite the journey.  Her performance will provide a special opportunity to see her once again at the top of her game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie Cole takes to the stage at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/sony-centre&quot;&gt;Sony Centre for the Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt; on June 25.  The &lt;a href=&quot;/artist/mario-romano-quartet&quot;&gt;Mario Romano Quartet&lt;/a&gt; opens up.  For complete information visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/natalie-cole&quot;&gt;Natalie Cole concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Karrin Allyson?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-karrin-allyson</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/karrin-allyson&quot;&gt;Karrin Allyson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a student at the University of Toronto, I remember one of my teachers suggesting that a good singer does more than just sing well - he or she is also a great band leader and has a clear idea of what he or she wants to happen on the bandstand.  Add to that package a background in classical piano and a total mastery of the voice as an instrument, and you&#039;ve got Karrin Allyson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m pretty picky when it comes to vocalists.  To me, a nice-sounding voice is only the starting point.  I also want to hear great control; confidence; interesting interpretation; and a certain degree of fearlessness.  Karrin Allyson possesses all of these qualities in spades.  Whether singing the melody, a written line or improvising, she&#039;s in total control of her instrument.  On this clip, she takes the Bobby Timmons classic &quot;Moanin&#039;&quot; and makes it sound like it was written for voice.  Plus - check out the line she sings with the guitar at 1:47:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/4lnQslFWzno?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What also impresses me about Karrin is the ease with which she performs a wide range of repertoire in a wide range of settings.  She&#039;s just as likely to be performing a duo with guitar (while sitting at the piano) as she is to be in front of a combo or a big band.  She&#039;s just as comfortable singing from the Great American Songbook as she is performing jazz standards, singing classic bossas in Portuguese or covering a Joni Mitchell tune. Regardless of the setting, she makes it sound easy.  Here she is in full bossa mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/AZGBeT5_mfQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Karrin Allyson has now released 13 albums on the Concord label; her most recent, &lt;i&gt;&#039;Round Midnight&lt;/i&gt;, was nominated for a 2012 Grammy Award in the Best Vocal Jazz category.  She&#039;s performed around the world and has earned a well-deserved reputation as a great bandleader.  When she steps on stage, the chemistry she produces  as an artist - and with her bandmates - will quickly become clear.  Here&#039;s Karrin talking about what inspires her musically, and what inspired &lt;i&gt;&#039;Round Midnight&lt;/i&gt; specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

Karrin Allyson performs on Sunday, June 24, 7 pm at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://torontojazz.com/content/jazz-lake-enwave-theatre&quot;&gt;Enwave Theatre&lt;/a&gt; (Harboufront Centre).
