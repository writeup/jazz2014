 <title>Nels Cline and Julian Lage?  Really?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/nels-cline-and-juian-lage-really</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/nels-cline&quot;&gt;Nels Cline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first blush, it may seem like an odd combination - a guitarist perhaps best known for playing in a rock band, but whose experience in jazz, punk and experimental music goes back decades; teaming up with a relative newcomer on the scene with an affinity for a more traditional approach. Having seen them perform together, though, I can assure you - they make beautiful music together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any musical partnership requires that each player have open years, and be able to react to what the other is doing.  Happily, the respective experience of these two particular guitarists lends itself well to an open-eared collaboration.  Nels Cline has made a name for himself performing in settings which require maximum flexibility - in his own Nels Cline Singers, with musicians like Tim Berne, Jim Black, Charlie Haden and Yoko Ono, and even with painter Norton Wisdom for a project called Stained Radiance. Julian Lage, recognized as a child prodigy, was taken under Gary Burton&#039;s wing but over the past several years has explored broad musical horizons for his own albums and in projects with Fred Hersch, Mark O&#039;Connor, John Patitucci, Bela Fleck and others.  The result is a mix of their various influences.  Here&#039;s a relatively straight-ahead sample which shows off some of the technique which has earned each guitarist acclaim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/BP1tFOcQA9c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Chops aside, though, to me the most interesting aspect of the duo is the musical travels their performances take.  I didn&#039;t really know about Nels Cline until recently when a colleague raved about him (I admit to not knowing much about Wilco); Julian Lage could (though less now) be classified as an emerging artist.  So when I saw the duo perform at Winter Jazzfest in New York in 2012, I wasn&#039;t exactly sure what to expect, other than &quot;this should probably be good.&quot;  It ended up being a highlight of the weekend for me.  When Lage and Cline perform together, they mix composition with spontaneous improvisation; groove-based playing with more ethereal textures; blues licks with what could be classical excerpts.  The result is unexpected, fascinating, and a joyful ride.  Here&#039;s another clip - this one travels a bit further afield than the first example above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/o9bt2AnT0eU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A concert featuring fully improvised music requires a different investment from an audience - there must be a willingness to suspend pre-conceived notions of melody and harmony, and to just go along for the ride. What reassures me, when I&#039;m entering into a less-familiar musical situation as an audience member, is the knowledge that the music will be performed at a high level. Nels Cline has been hailed by &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; as one of the top 100 guitarists of all time, while Julian Lage was recently a winner in the &lt;i&gt;Downbeat Magazine&lt;/i&gt; &quot;Rising Star Guitar&quot; category.  So you will be in good musical hands when these two take the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to find online a (somewhat shaky) recording of that Winter Jazzfest show which impressed me so - here&#039;s a clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/-G5XmSRlt64?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Nels Cline/Julian Lage Duo performs at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, June 24 at 10 pm.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91BD47B693&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/nels-cline-julian-lage-duo&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Jon Ballantyne?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-jon-ballantyne</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/jon-ballantyne&quot;&gt;Jon Ballantyne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pianist Jon Ballantyne is a bit hard to pin down - and that&#039;s a good thing.  Equally comfortable playing in small groups or solo; inside the changes or far out; standards or original compositions, Jon always makes each tune, and each solo, his own. A quick look at his performance history demonstrates why he moves smoothly among styles.  He&#039;s shared the stage with more straightahead players like Woody Herman, Barry Harris, Joe Henderson and Joe Lovano, and also with stalwarts of the more improvisation-based side of jazz like Dewey Redman, Dave Liebman, Kenny Wheeler and Cecil Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no small feat to be truly at home across musical styles.  I feel Jon&#039;s playing exudes a confidence which comes only from delving deeply into each style.  In a group setting, his soloing reflects his influences while still being true to the tune being performed - even with a large vocabulary from which to choose, Jon makes beautiful musical choices.  Here&#039;s a sample - an excerpted solo from a quartet performance.  I like the journey the solo takes - I hear some straight-ahead playing, some Thelonious Monk, and flashes of a player who can easily take things outside as required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/X93MGES_r10?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is perhaps in a solo setting though that Jon&#039;s brilliance is most on display. (His solo album &lt;i&gt;Avenue Standard&lt;/i&gt; won a 2007 JUNO Award.) Just as he has mastered various musical styles, he has mastered the art of playing solo.  He knows how to get the most orchestral sounds out of the piano, and which notes to play when, making it easy to forget there is only one musician on stage.  Playing his original solo compositions - or a solo spontaneous improvisation - Jon is also perhaps at his most creative. Without a standard set of chord changes (or even chord changes at all), he&#039;s able to take listeners on a unique journey.  We may not be sure where we&#039;ll end up, but we can be assured of a smooth landing.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;236&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/92kqnlGz6lk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a recent Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz - Live! session, I asked Bill King about what separates the pianists who &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; play solo from those that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; soloists.  He had lots to say on the matter (you can hear the full session &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/artistic-directors-guide-jazz-live-bill-king&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but what stuck out in particular was his suggestion that great piano soloists know how to use the whole piano - from the very top to the very bottom - and some of the best examples of great piano soloists were stride players.  The stride style of playing - with the left hand constantly moving from bass note to chordal accompaniment - required an intimate knowledge of when notes in all registers would sound best.  It is perhaps no surprise then that, among the styles in which Jon Ballantyne comfortably performs, is stride piano.  Here&#039;s a sample which starts off stride-ish, then travels in a whole new direction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/8JRRnP99CSw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jon Ballantyne performs solo on Tuesday, June 24, 8 pm at &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/jazz-bistro&quot;&gt;Jazz Bistro&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C9200D9741E&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit his &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/jon-ballantyne-solo-piano&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s sure to be a great ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hugh Marsh</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hughmarsh.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://hughmarsh.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Hugh_Marsh_5x7%20-%20web.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violinist, composer, dreamer Hugh Marsh is widely regarded as Canada&#039;s leading improvising violinist. He studied classical violin from age 5 until 20, however it was picking up the saxophone in high school that led him to exploring other musics, especially jazz, funk, and r&amp;amp;b.  It was Marsh&#039;s father who suggested he apply his newfound love of improvisation on the saxophone to the violin and one day Hugh returned home from school to discover a Balilla amp and a DeArmond pickup for his violin in the living room. A wah wah pedal soon followed and Marsh&#039;s interest in sound processing was born.  In 1977 Marsh and longtime friend drummer Kevan Mckenzie made the move from Ottawa to Toronto. During this first sojourn Hugh had the opportunity to play with many of the Canadian jazz musicians whose work he had long admired including Moe Koffman, Don Thompson, Doug Riley, Claude Ranger and Sonny Greenwich.  While visiting his parents at Christmas 1979 Marsh performed at a benefit for the Children&#039;s Hospital in Ottawa with guitarist Roddy Elias and was introduced to singer songwriter Bruce Cockburn who was performing at the same event. This fortuitous meeting resulted in numerous recordings and world tours with Bruce over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides touring with Cockburn, Hugh became in demand as a gun for hire performing on numerous recordings and touring with Canadian songstress Mary Margaret O&#039;Hara among others. In 1990 while overdubbing violin on Loreena Mckennitt&#039;s breakthrough album &quot;The Visit&quot; he was invited to join her band leading once again to numerous world tours and recordings over the next eight years. After performing in Los Angeles at the Universal Amphitheater in 1998 with Loreena, Hugh received a phone call from Touchstone Pictures about performing on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Armageddon&quot;.  The soundtrack was a steppingstone to Marsh&#039;s ongoing working relationship with Gregson Williams which has included the scores to &quot;Whatever Happened to Harold Smith&quot;, &quot;Spygame&quot;, &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot;, &quot;Sinbad&quot;, &quot;The Rundown&quot;, &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, &quot;Return to Sender&quot;, &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;Seraphim Falls&quot;, &quot;Deja Vu&quot; and &quot;The Number 23&quot;. Hugh is also the featured violin soloist on Hans Zimmer&#039;s score to &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugh Marsh toured with Goth icon Peter Murphy in 2000 and 2002, has been an ongoing member of Turkish Dj Mercan Dede&#039;s Secret Tribe project, one quarter of &quot;Nick Buzz&quot;, and most recently joined clarinet visionary Don Byron&#039;s new quartet &quot;Swiftboat&quot;which includes Kermit Driscoll and Pheeroan Aklaff. Hugh is about to release his third solo recording entitled &quot;Hug Mars&quot;, which features poet Ursula Rucker, James Blood Ulmer, Tanya Tagaq Gillis, Kokayi, Gregoire Maret, Andy Milne, Dafnis Prieto, Pancho Quinto and Pedro Martinez among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsh is a four time recipient of the Jazz Report award for violinist of the year and a two time winner of the National Jazz award for violinist of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

Combining breathtaking technique with an informed musical intelligence, the self-taught Cline displays a mastery of guitar expression that encompasses delicate lyricism, sonic abstractions, and skull-crunching flights of fancy, inspiring Jazz Times to call him &quot;The World&#039;s Most Dangerous Guitarist.&quot; His recording and performing career - spanning jazz, rock, punk, and experimental - is well into its fourth decade, with over 130 recordings, including at least 30 for which he is leader. Born in Los Angeles in 1956, Cline has received many accolades including Rolling Stone anointing him as both one of 20 &quot;new guitar gods&quot; and one of the top 100 guitarists of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Jaron Freeman-Fox and the Opposite of Everything</title>

With a diverse cast of Toronto’s finest and most adventurous musicians, the band has toured the country coast to coast, and showcased their highly original music at festivals as diverse as The Ottawa Jazz Festival, The Newfoundland Sound Symposium, The Vancouver Folk Festival, and recently at world music expo WOMEX, held this year in Thessaloniki, Greece.  After three years of touring and perfecting their repertoire, the band finally has a new album showcasing the full breadth of their sound, and will be releasing it in February 2013!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fronting the ensemble, Jaron Freeman-Fox dances down the fine line between the beautiful and the ridiculous, while redefining what the violin can do.  Having played on over 40 albums (Jayme Stone, Autorickshaw, Peter Katz) and having toured the world many times over as a side-man with bands such as The David Woodhead Confabulation and Delhi 2 Dublin, Freeman-Fox fuses his roots of Celtic and bluegrass fiddling with his study of Indian classical music and jazz, playing the 5-string violins of his late mentor; fiddle pioneer Oliver Schroer.  In 2010 Jaron released his award-winning instrumental debut album &lt;i&gt;Manic Almanac : Slow Möbius&lt;/i&gt; and formed this fiery band The Opposite of Everything. Since then, Jaron has performed in Brunei, Indonesia, India, throughout the US, UK, Europe and at festivals across Canada, for crowds of over 100,000, royalty, and audiences dressed as wizards. (True story!)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Who, exactly, is Kneebody?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/who-exactly-kneebody</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/kneebody&quot;&gt;Kneebody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Kneebody&#039;s website, the bio for the Grammy-nominated, jazz-rock quintet is understandably vague:  trying to summarize their music in one neat sentence (or paragraph) is no easy task.  What I can tell you, is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They released their first album in 2005 on Dave Douglas&#039; Greenleaf Music label&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their 2009 release, with Theo Bleckmann singing music composed and inspired by Charles Ives, earned the group a Grammy nomination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trumpeter Shane Endsley has been named one of the Top 25 trumpeters of his generation by &lt;i&gt;Downbeat Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saxophonist Ben Wendel is an award-winning composer who has performed with, among others, Ignacio Berroa, Tigran Hamasyan and Snoop Dogg (yes, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Snoop Dogg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pianist Adam Benjamin has twice been named a rising star in &lt;i&gt;Downbeat Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, has toured with Dave Douglas, Joshua Redman and Beck, and has written scores for a variety of films&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bassist Kaveh Rastegar has played with musicians ranging from Nels Cline to Antibalas to Cee Lo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drummer Nate Wood is an accomplished multi-instrumentalist - on his first solo album he composes, sings, engineers and plays all the instruments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ensemble of musicians with such an eclectic combination of tastes and experiences perhaps logically produces a diverse mix of music.  Here&#039;s a teaser from their first release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/j79nOQV3D3w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What strikes me first about Kneebody&#039;s music is that even though there is a lot going on in their compositions, it often sounds simple.  The melody in this tune, for example, is fairly clear; I don&#039;t notice the various changing time signatures or shifting rhythmic patterns - and that&#039;s a good thing.  It&#039;s a compliment to the musicians that they make it sound so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I describe Kneebody&#039;s music in the opening paragraph of this post as &quot;jazz-rock&quot;.  It doesn&#039;t cover the full range of their repertoire, but much of their music features driving, rock-influenced beats, electric instruments (keyboard, bass, and lots of effects for trumpet and sax), and a joyful, rock-like, reckless abandon.  The fusion resonates with me on a basic level - again, it&#039;s not important to know exactly what&#039;s going on in a tune if I&#039;m grooving to the music.  Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;

A further compliment to these musicians is the variety of styles in which they play.  They&#039;re not afraid to go a bit &quot;outside&quot; or try something different.  Their 2009, Grammy-nominated album, featuring Theo Bleckmann, is a great example:  with Theo on vocals, they tackle music written and inspired by Charles Ives to great effect.  These are not jazz standards by any stretch and they truly make them their own.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/xZA1V-6Uihw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whether your tastes are &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;far out&quot;, Kneebody will rock your socks.  When they take the stage, you can count on pure energy and intensity from the first note to the last.  They represent an exciting trend in jazz:  great musicians, great music, and an interesting fusion of styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kneebody performs at &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/rivoli&quot;&gt;The Rivoli&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, June 29 at 10 pm.  For complete information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/kneebody&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about The Bad Plus?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-bad-plus</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/bad-plus&quot;&gt;Bad Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been lucky enough to see The Bad Plus perform live a couple of times, and I have this to say:  when a band is truly operating as a unit, it&#039;s as if the music is being made by some magical force.  The musicians don&#039;t seem to be communicating; there are no obvious visual or aural cues being passed back and forth.  Everything just kind of...happens.  The Bad Plus is such a unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard The Bad Plus on the radio.  It&#039;s possible that is was their version of the Tears for Fears classic &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World.&quot;  I was immediately intrigued by two things:  first, here was a jazz trio doing a cover of a tune I grew up with.  Second, I felt like there was something slightly off kilter about it - in a playful, musical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this double-whammy - familiar tunes and a unique performance style - is what first brought The Bad Plus to the attention of jazz fans around the world.  But they&#039;re so much more than pop covers.  They&#039;ve been playing together for more than ten years, so when pianist Ethan Iverson decides to depart from the melody, or drummer Dave King decides to depart from the time signature, or bassist Reid Anderson decides to depart from the harmony, the other musicians easily take it in stride, sometimes playing along, and sometimes playing it straight...and always creating sparks on the bandstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But - as someone once said - &quot;Talking about music is like dancing about architecture.&quot;  Here&#039;s a track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/20623505&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The tune may not be familiar - in fact, their most recent album is their first exclusively featuring the band&#039;s original compositions - but the groove certainly is.  In some ways, when I listen to a track like this, it doesn&#039;t necessarily matter if I always recognize the tune, or understand exactly what the individual musicians are doing.  The music gets my head bopping, keeps me on my toes, and always surprises me.  It means that their shows are always a bit unpredictable, and always fun.  In case more proof is required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/OruzDa0He-g?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here the trio combines unison passages (Ethan&#039;s left hand playing the bass line with Reid, for example) with total freedom (Dave&#039;s powerhouse drumming) and to me, the end-result is some of the most exciting music being made in jazz today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad Plus performs on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot;&gt;mainstage at Nathan Phillips Square&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, June 24.  Joining the trio is the outstanding tenor saxophonist &lt;a href=&quot;/artist/joshua-redman&quot;&gt;Joshua Redman&lt;/a&gt; (speaking of exciting!); &lt;a href=&quot;/artist/hiromi-trio-project&quot;&gt;Hiromi&#039;s Trio Project&lt;/a&gt; kicks off the double bill at 8 pm.  For complete details, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/hiromi-trio-project-bad-plus-special-guest-joshua-redman&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here&#039;s a behind-the-scenes video on the making of the 2010 release &lt;i&gt;Never Stop&lt;/i&gt;.  It might give you a better sense of the personalities of the musicians and their creative process as a band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. - Ethan Iverson, in addition to being an outstanding pianist, is an interesting and acclaimed blogger.  Check out his blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://dothemath.typepad.com/dtm/contents.html&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Do The Math&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
