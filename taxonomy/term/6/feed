Indeed, Bill was solicited personally by no less than Sir James Galway to serve as his Resident Jazz Flute Specialist at Sir James’ official web site.&lt;br /&gt;
Bill is also recognized as an accomplished improviser – notably in the bebop, swing and Latin idioms – as demonstrated by his recordings as a sideman with the likes of Junior Mance, Irakere, Emilie-Claire Barlow, Memo Acevedo and Cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Bill has produced two Extreme Flute projects and, in addition, three acoustic jazz/Latin recordings under his own name, “Nature Boy”, (featuring The Mark Eisenman Trio), “Paco Paco” (featuring Bernie Senensky) and “Mercy” (featuring Robi Botos) all of which have entered in Jazz.FM91&#039;s Top 40 line-ups as well as being included regularly in the spin cycle of Bob Parlocha’s widely syndicated US jazz radio show.  Amongst Bill’s various awards is the citation of his most recent release, “Mercy”, as Best Jazz Album at the 2010 Toronto Independent Music Awards and his selection as winner in the inaugural National Flute Association&#039;s 2012 Jazz Flute Soloist Competition.&lt;br /&gt;
Bernie Senensky – Piano&lt;br /&gt;
Bernie Senensky has earned the reputation of being one of Canada&#039;s premier jazz artists – on any instrument.  His playing has been featured internationally in countless jazz festivals, clubs, concerts and recordings.  Indeed, he is now recognized as one of the foremost jazz pianists – anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernie was twice voted &quot;Best Acoustic Pianist&quot; in the Jazz Report Awards.  He has also been awarded the SOCAN &quot;Best Jazz Composition&quot; award (for his piece, “Blues for Clifford”).  Over his long and stellar career, he has recorded 13 albums as a leader (most recently, “Invitation” with Gene Perla and Ben Riley)—three of which have received Juno nominations.  He has also participated in an endless list of performances and recordings alongside the biggest names in jazz including the following:  Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, Joe Williams, Zoot Sims, Chet Baker, Art Pepper, Randy Brecker, Pepper Adams, Phil Woods, Donald Byrd, Sonny Stitt, Herbie Mann, Moe Koffman, Peter Appleyard and Elvin Jones.&lt;br /&gt;
Here are just a few reactions from fellow musicians:  Drumming legend, Elvin Jones, called Bernie, &quot;One of the finest pianists I have worked with in my career&quot;.  Piano icon, Bill Evans, on hearing him declared, &quot;I could just sit and listen to him play all day!&quot;  Clarinetist, Buddy DeFranco, described him simply as, &quot;The best of the best&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Hadar Noiberg?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-hadar-noiberg</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/hadar-noiberg-trio&quot;&gt;Hadar Noiberg Trio &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that you are judged by the company you keep.  If the idiom was applied to Israeli-born flautist Hadar Noiberg, the result would be overwhelmingly positive.  Although she may be a new name, you&#039;ll certainly recognize some of her musical collaborators:  she is a founding member of the jazz/world fusion group Yemen Blues, and has shared the stage with Anat Cohen, Omer Avital, Joel Frahm, Rufus Reid and many more.  However, Hadar Noiberg stands perfectly well on her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadar&#039;s career started at a young age playing and touring with the Young Philharmonic Orchestra and studying at the Tel Aviv Academy.  At age 21 she moved to New York, completing her Bachelor&#039;s degree in flute and composition.  In 2007 she received an award from the ASCAP foundation for her composition skills.  Here&#039;s a brief video introduction to Hadar Noiberg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/hGZEwhmOiUA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What intrigues me most about Hadar Noiberg is the diversity of cultures I hear represented in her playing and composing.  The rich multicultural tradition of the Middle East is evident whenever she takes the stage:  I hear Israeli, Arabic, North African and Indian influences, among others.  She&#039;s also a passionate devotee of the Afro-Cuban tradition; she seems to be playing with a different collection of musicians in every video I&#039;ve seen!  Yemen Blues in one, her jazz trio in another, Cuban musicians in yet another...it&#039;s no surprise that, given her diverse musical interests, she has played on some of the biggest jazz and world music stages around the globe.  Here&#039;s a performance of the title track from her new trio CD, &lt;i&gt;Journey Back Home&lt;/i&gt;.  It starts with what could be an Israeli folk tune, moves into a straight-ahead jazz waltz, and wraps up in a more North African feel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/7SRPCLy1s0Q?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hadar Noiberg brings her outstanding playing and diverse repertoire to the Al Green Theatre this Thursday, November 22 at 8 pm for a concert celebrating the new album, &lt;i&gt;Journey Back Home&lt;/i&gt;.  She will be joined by Edward Perez on bass and Ziv Ravitz on drums.  I&#039;m looking forward to seeing them in action - it&#039;s sure to be a musical tour of the world.  For complete information visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/hadar-noiberg-trio&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/brian-katz</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Katz/Ernie Tollar&lt;br /&gt;
Brian Katz is widely acclaimed for his personal approach to playing modern jazz on the classical guitar and piano, and for his evocative compositions; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxophonist/bansuri flautist Ernie Tollar has an outstanding ability to synthesize diverse musical traditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KATZTOLLAR mostly performs original compositions in the “world jazz” genre: the  music is rooted in the modern jazz tradition and extends outwards to embrace elements of Middle Eastern, East Indian, Classical and various folk traditions.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bill McBirnie &amp; Louis Simao</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/bill-mcbirnie-louis-simao</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.extremeflute.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.extremeflute.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Bill%20McBirnie_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join this incredible duo as they perform songs from Brazil, Portugal and the Portuguese diaspora.  Bill&#039;s extreme flute and Louis&#039; masterful guitar and vocals are sure to transport you into summer with a beautiful and nuanced performance.  (Reservations are encouraged at this venue because it is both intimate and usually booked solid!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-instrumentalist, composer, singer and producer, Louis Simão, represents the voice of a new generation within the broad spectrum of lusophone music.  His sound is a cry and celebration of saudade from the distant past and the unlikely outpost of Portugal.  Although he is intimately linked to Portuguese folkloric music through the accordion and guitar, he is also steeped in the Brazilian idiom as well as modern jazz in his capacity as a multi-faceted vocalist, guitarist, bassist, pianist and percussionist.  His original works enable his listeners to experience the sounds of Portuguese folk music and fado, MPB and the rhythms of Brazil along with strains of Angolan music fused with funk and reggae—all rounded out by an improvisatory approach with a well-honed jazz sensibility.  Subtle and ostensibly simple, Simão&#039;s music is, in fact, executed with finesse, harmonic sophistication and a solid groove.  His rhythmic conception is entrenched in Afro-Brazilian and Afro-Portuguese rhythms which, in conjunction with his sensitive lyrical and highly melodic concept, offer a musical journey that blends cultural genres utilizing the Portuguese folkloric material as a common thread.  Louis is a truly astonishing and refreshing first-generation Canadian artist with one foot in his native country of Canada and the other squarely in his parents’ customs and traditions of Portugal resulting in a unique musical sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill is a jazz and Latin flute specialist based in Toronto, Ontario.  He has studied with distinguished Canadian flutist and composer, Robert Aitken, and Cuban charanga legend, Richard Egues.  Bill is known for his exceptional technique on the entire family of flutes – from bass flute to piccolo.  He is also recognized as an accomplished improviser – notably in the bebop, swing and Latin idioms – as illustrated by his recordings as a sideman with the likes of Junior Mance, Irakere, Emilie-Claire Barlow, Memo Acevedo and Cache.  He has produced two Extreme Flute projects and, in addition, two straight-ahead acoustic jazz recordings under his own name, “Nature Boy”, (featuring The Mark Eisenman Trio) and “Paco Paco” (with Bernie Senensky) both of which have entered in Jazz.FM91&#039;s Top 40 line-ups as well as being in the spin cycle of Bob Parlocha’s widely syndicated jazz radio show in the U.S.  He has also been declared a winner at the USA National Flute Association’s Jazz Flute Masterclass Competition, chosen Flutist of the Year by the Jazz Report Awards and, more recently, nominated as Instrumentalist of the Year (for flute) and Album of the Year (for &quot;Paco Paco&quot;) at the National Jazz Awards.  Also, Bill has been recruited by no less than Sir James Galway to serve as his Resident Jazz Flute Specialist at the official Sir James Galway web site.&lt;/p&gt;
