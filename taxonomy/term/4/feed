 <title>What the heck is Mehliana?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/what-heck-mehliana</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/mehliana&quot;&gt;Mehliana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short, factual answer:  Mehliana is the combination of pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Mark Guiliana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short, opinionated answer:  Mehliana is awesomesauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that the combination of two heavyweight artists would produce new, creative and exciting music. Brad Mehldau and Mark Guiliana are each highly acclaimed for their own variety of projects.  Brad is most frequently seen with his trio, but he&#039;s also played regularly with Joshua Redman, Pat Metheny and others. Mark Guiliana was the drummer with bassist Avishai Cohen for eight years, and has played with artists ranging from Meshell Ndegeocello to Matisyahu to Bobby McFerrin. Mehliana puts on display some of the musical and technical approaches for which each musician is recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A duo of piano and drums is rare, but when these two creative musicians get together any challenges which might arise from the unique instrumentation disappear. Rather than trying to force their instruments into one style or another, I feel they are capitalizing on what each instrument does best.  More often than not, that means great grooves from Mark, and great melodic soloing from Brad.  Here&#039;s a taste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/tn6gjoMUEY4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A couple of other points come to mind when I hear Mehliana play.  First, Brad and Mark are well-equipped to tackle complex rhythmic and harmonic playing.  If you want a polyrhythmic, super-imposed tuplet of one sort or another or a slash chord with all of the extensions, they could easily give you that.  But Mehliana is not the outlet for that kind of playing.  Instead, they seem to be concentrating on making music more reminiscent  of dance music.  Longer, groove based jams.  They still throw in a fancy lick here and there, but audiences of all kinds should be able to listen and bop along.  Of course, it takes two master musicians to sustain interest in tunes which tend to be longer than standard radio play - but there are no worries on that front with these two. Through multiple listenings of the album I continue to be intrigued. And, as we&#039;ll see with the track below, you never know where a longer tune might take you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/cnH27mxW0KM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Mehliana&#039;s recently-released CD, &lt;i&gt;Taming the Dragon&lt;/i&gt;, features twelve compositions - six by the duo, and six by Brad Mehldau.  And in this case, composition means many things:  melody and harmony, as usual; but as we&#039;ve seen in the video samples above, they have also thought about how to expand the sonic landscape available to them.  By incorporating synthesizers, pedals, effects, drum machines and other electronics, they have a huge palette from which to choose.  And they use it to great effect.  One more example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Mrokp2Pmapg?list=RDtn6gjoMUEY4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With Mehliana we&#039;re sure to get a mix of composed music and improvisation; a great mix of styles, from street beat to drum and bass to funk and jazz-rock; and a driving, synth-laden, melodic musical treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehliana performs on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square on Saturday, June 28 at 8 pm, on a double-bill with the Stanley Clarke Trio.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C90040ED514&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/mehliana-stanley-clarke-trio&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As Sean&#039;s Career progressed, he found himself the recipient of many awards and accolades including the &quot;Woody Herman Jazz Award”, an award for outstanding musicianship, as well as the Louis Armstrong Scholarship. Due to Sean&#039;s great talent both as a player and an educator, he has been the focus of countless news articles jazz radio programs and documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jazz drummer works regularly with his quintet the Modern Jazz Messengers, makes the rounds with his longstanding trio, holds the drum chair in the Detroit Jazz Festival Orchestra, and makes music for the new Mack Avenue Records imprint the Detroit Music Factory. When he isn&#039;t clubbing or in the studio. he teaches at a couple of colleges, and he runs the Detroit Symphony Orchestra&#039;s Civic Jazz program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He favors the hard-bop branch of jazz. So, it’s refreshing to see him in a more soulful and funk driven light. Organ player Chris Codish, guitar player Ralph Tope and sax player Marcus Elliot is the core of the band.    &lt;/p&gt;

He is regarded by his peers as a musical drummer and a supportive accompanist. Jazz great Bill Evans summed it up best when he said that “Joe is very dedicated to playing quality music, and he’s willing to make the concessions of dues toward that end. He’s a top soloist and he does the right thing at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently residing in Los Angeles, Joe is involved in a wide range of music locally, nationally and internationally. On the local scene he is busy with his own quintet as well as sideman duties with many well known jazz artists. Recent dates in North America include performances with Bill Mays, Eddie Daniels, Randy Brecker and brother Pat LaBarbera.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Alan Jones Sextet</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/alan-jones-sextet</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alanjonesmusic.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.alanjonesmusic.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/alan_jones.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Jones Canadian All Star Sextet&lt;br /&gt;
Alan Jones likes to jump off high places. Off cliffs into the water, where you have to time the waves’&lt;br /&gt;
surge just right to survive the plunge. He’ll do a flip, too, 70 feet in the air, just to give it some style.&lt;br /&gt;
Risky leaps with grace and style: That’s also what the jazz composer, drummer, and bandleader Alan&lt;br /&gt;
Jones likes in his music. That sense of graceful adventure is what Alan&#039;s compositions are all about.&lt;br /&gt;
The Alan Jones Canadian All Star Sextet delivers unpredictable improvisations framed by lush melodic&lt;br /&gt;
passages set in narrative compositions. It&#039;s free, but with a swampy, heavy pocket that offers the&lt;br /&gt;
romance of risk without complete disorientation.&lt;br /&gt;
The first incarnation of the Alan Jones Sextet was formed in 1985 during Alan&#039;s time as a student at the&lt;br /&gt;
renowned Banff Centre. Ironically, that original sextet, including Phil Dwyer and Jon Ballantyne,&lt;br /&gt;
looked very similar to what his ideal sextet looks like today; 27 years and volumes of musical&lt;br /&gt;
explorations later.&lt;br /&gt;
It was also in Banff, impressed by Alan&#039;s original compositions, that both Kenny Wheeler and Don&lt;br /&gt;
Thomson encouraged him to continue composing seriously. This inspiring endorsement led to the&lt;br /&gt;
formation of a second, European sextet that included (ironically again), Ingrid Jensen. These groups&lt;br /&gt;
served as precursors for the band that would go on to record three CDs of Alan&#039;s startlingly original&lt;br /&gt;
music, produced by the brilliant pop icon Gino Vannelli.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, finally, The Alan Jones Sextet&#039;s latest and “ideal” embodiment is an unbelievable, generational&lt;br /&gt;
super group comprised of some of todays most provocative jazz musicians.&lt;br /&gt;
Alan Jones&lt;br /&gt;
Known for his vitality and swing, Jones is a passionate mountain climber, builds his own drums, and&lt;br /&gt;
plays barefoot. The Toronto Globe and Mail called his trio performance at the Top of the Senator with&lt;br /&gt;
Phil Dwyer and Rodney Whittaker one of the &quot;Top 10 moments in Canadian jazz.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
He has performed, toured and recorded with a long list of jazz legends including Andrew Hill, Leroy&lt;br /&gt;
Vinnegar, Red Mitchell, Dave Holland, Kenny Wheeler, John Abercrombie, Jim Pepper, Miroslav&lt;br /&gt;
Vitous, Airto Moriera, George Cables, Lee Konitz, Ralph Towner and Charles McPherson.&lt;br /&gt;
A master teacher in the best jazz tradition, Alan&#039;s love and understanding of music and his ability to&lt;br /&gt;
communicate, both as a player and a teacher led him to the creation of The Alan Jones Academy of&lt;br /&gt;
Music. AJAM is an innovative education system focused on personal and collective improvisation&lt;br /&gt;
from grade school through retirement, and prompted the city of Portland to honor him with an award&lt;br /&gt;
for “Outstanding Achievement in Jazz”.&lt;br /&gt;
Seamus Blake is recognized as one of the finest exponents of contemporary jazz, anywhere. Winning&lt;br /&gt;
the Thelonious Monk Competition gave Seamus the opportunity to perform alongside Wayne Shorter&lt;br /&gt;
and Herbie Hancock. As a leader, Seamus has released six albums on Criss Cross Records. As a&lt;br /&gt;
sideman, Seamus has worked and/or recorded with a plethora of the best musicians in the genre, and&lt;br /&gt;
continues to be one of Canada&#039;s most recognizable jazz musicians.&lt;br /&gt;
The list of Phil Dwyer&#039;s accomplishments is dizzyingly extensive... for the sake of brevity let&#039;s just say&lt;br /&gt;
that the mantle above his fireplace can&#039;t really hold any more awards. With recording credits including&lt;br /&gt;
well over 100 commercial releases and hundreds more radio, television, and film sessions, Dwyer is&lt;br /&gt;
one of the most recorded, prolific, admired and respected musicians in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;
“Ingrid Jensen plays the trumpet and flugelhorn with all the brilliance and fire of a virtuoso...”&lt;br /&gt;
Marian McPartland. Her three CD&#039;s for the ENJA label and her latest, At Sea, won her nominations&lt;br /&gt;
from the Juno Awards, including an award in 1995 for Vernal Fields. Ingrid has built her impressive&lt;br /&gt;
career on an instantly recognizable, beautifully personal tone and approach that has taken her as a&lt;br /&gt;
leader and as a featured soloist to the far corners of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
Jon Ballantyne has released 9 albums, won 2 Juno awards and received 3 Juno nominations as a&lt;br /&gt;
leader. He has played New York jazz clubs with Joe Henderson, duo piano concerts with Paul Bley, and&lt;br /&gt;
collaborated with Dewey Redman, Billy Hart, Roy Haynes, Dave Liebman and Joe Lovano. Jon has&lt;br /&gt;
toured Europe, Israel, Canada and the US with his acclaimed quartet including Boris Kozlov, Jeff&lt;br /&gt;
Hirshfield and Douglas Yates and is one of the most exciting piano players one is likely to hear.&lt;br /&gt;
For almost 40 years, Tom Wakeling has put his bass to work in concert halls, jazz nightclubs,&lt;br /&gt;
recording studios, and at music festivals throughout North America and Europe.&lt;br /&gt;
Tom has supported a wide range of artists including Arturo Sandoval, Lee Konitz, and Mel Torme.&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone wants him because he knows what the bass player is supposed to do, and then... he does it.&lt;/p&gt;

Hands, sticks and mallets pound out old and new rhythms on weathered skins, evoking ancient forms of ‘messaging’ via global beats for dancing bodies and curious ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With layered drumming and poly-meter at the core, many of DRUMHAND’s accessible and edgy compositions feature the one-stringed ‘stomach harp’ of Brazil or the box- shaped Gome foot-drum of West Africa alongside the woodwind explorations of Marcus Ali (Cruzao/Jason Wilson) and brass love of Rebecca Hennessy (Hobson’s Choice/ Woodshed Orchestra). The group’s ‘folkloric’-style vocals appear in a variety of languages and sometimes offer audiences a part in the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three albums and several tour miles later, DRUMHAND is becoming increasingly known for innovative orchestrations, dynamic and uplifting performance energy and artistic accessibility for audiences of all ages. Their unique inclusiveness can be experienced in concert at festivals (The Blue Skies Festival, DEEP ROOTS Music Festival, Ottawa Jazz Festival, to name a few), at school performances and in music venues, at street parties and in nightclubs across Canada and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
