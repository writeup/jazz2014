 <title>What&#039;s so good about Joey DeFrancesco?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-joey-defrancesco</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/joey-defrancesco&quot;&gt;Joey DeFrancesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m trying to figure out where exactly my love of the Hammond B3 organ sound comes from.  I didn&#039;t grow up listening to blues or gospel; I went to synagogue, not church; and my record collection is more big band and trumpet than keys.  But somewhere along the way, I took out a Jimmy Smith CD from the library and something clicked.  Since then, a well-played gospelly, bluesy organ has resonated somewhere deep within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we&#039;re going to talk about Hammond B3 organ, we must talk about Joey DeFrancesco.  Essentially, Joey DeFrancesco encapsulates in his playing everything that comes to mind when I think about great organ:  he swings like crazy; his vocabulary includes all of the blues and gospel licks which sound so great on the instrument; and his playing exudes the sense of fun for which I feel the instrument may have been created. Let&#039;s launch right in to a track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/dFcVaitADW8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In that one track, he shows off what&#039;s made him one of the best in the world: gospelly goodness off the top, great blues licks, and technical virtuosity.  What you might not have noticed - especially if you haven&#039;t seen many organists play live - is what&#039;s happening underneath the keyboard. While his hands are busy playing the chords and melodies (and soloing), Joey&#039;s feet are busy holding down the bass line.  I don&#039;t know enough about how organists train to suggest that all organists learn this skill; what I do know - having seen a few - is that not all organists use their feet in performance. Just another notch in the &quot;complete package&quot; column for DeFrancesco! Here&#039;s a clip demonstrating his fancy footwork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/XfolH2D-ZzI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Any great musician - and any great combo - knows exactly when to ratchet up the tension or the excitement in a performance.  For me, somehow the sound of the organ heightens that musical tension even more.  Maybe it&#039;s the  way certain chords sound and feel especially crunchy - so when they resolve, the resolution is particularly satisfactory. I&#039;m not sure.  What I do know is that Joey DeFrancesco understands perfectly how to create and release musical tension, and how best to use the instrument to his advantage. Here&#039;s a clip of two organ masters - Joey along with Dr. Lonnie Smith - which demonstrates two different styles of organ playing:&lt;/p&gt;

Joey DeFrancesco takes the stage along with Jeff Parker (guitar) and George Fludas (drums) on June 25, 8 pm at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91BE51B7A7&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit his &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/joey-defrancesco-trio&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Roy Hargrove?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-roy-hargrove-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/roy-hargrove-quintet&quot;&gt;Roy Hargrove Quintet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, I must reveal my bias.  I&#039;m a trumpet player.  And so any other trumpet player with outstanding sound and technique is going to rank fairly high on my list.  But that&#039;s not all that&#039;s good about Roy Hargrove...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick look at some of Hargrove&#039;s acclaimed projects reveals the breadth of his ability.  He won Grammy awards in 1997 (Best Latin Jazz Performance with his Cuban-based band Crisol) and 2002 (Best Instrumental Jazz Album for his contribution to &lt;i&gt;Directions in Music&lt;/i&gt;, the Herbie Hancock-led tribute to Miles Davis and John Coltrane).  In 2003 he introduced the world to his funk/hip-hop/jazz collective the RH Factor; and in 2010 he appeared at the TD Toronto Jazz Festival fronting a big band.  It could be said that every album he&#039;s released has been different from the previous album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things appeal to me in particular about Roy&#039;s playing.  First is his sound.  Oftentimes when a player&#039;s technique is discussed, what&#039;s being referred to is his or her ability to easily get around the instrument - high, low, fast, slow.  Roy&#039;s got that ability, but he&#039;s also got incredible control over his sound.  It&#039;s beautiful, round and full, but in the middle of an intense solo, he easily converts it to a fiery force with which to be reckoned.  Second is his ability to truly tell a story when soloing.  With Roy it seems to not be all about technique - he builds on each phrase, extending it out to complete a musical paragraph.  Check it out (Roy&#039;s solo starts at about 5:38):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/jCatQQL6cds&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The third thing I notice about Roy&#039;s playing is how funky it is.  In a group like the RH Factor, that may be expected; but even in his quintet, Roy not only swings - he grooves.  Here&#039;s a track that demonstrates these various aspects:  the melody shows off the ease with which he gets around the horn; his solo (which starts at about 4:15) starts off simply but then builds to a fever pitch, showing off his range of sound; and the whole thing just grooves like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/qxeb0cwjE8U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We talk a lot these days about the cross-over between jazz and hip-hop, and there are a number of musicians who have garnered attention for recent &quot;genre-bending&quot; albums.  A mix of jazz, gospel, funk and hip-hop has been a part of Roy Hargrove&#039;s playing and composing for years; with projects like the RH Factor he has explicitly explored the relationship between jazz and other genres.  These musical explorations, coupled with his technique on the instrument, has inspired a generation of musicians. Here he is talking a bit about the evolution of jazz - from swing to hip hop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/6z1ChouasFU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Roy Hargrove Quintet (Roy along with Justin Robinson on alto sax &amp;amp; flute, Sullivan Fortner on piano, Ameem Saleem on bass, and Quincy Phillips on drums) performs on Friday, June 27, 8 pm at &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/jane-mallet-theatre-st-lawrence-centre-arts&quot;&gt;Jane Mallett Theatre&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://boxoffice.stlc.com/public/show.asp?shcode=989&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, go to his &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/roy-hargrove-quintet&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Lettuce?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-lettuce</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/lettuce&quot;&gt;Lettuce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I took acting classes in high school (stay with me - I&#039;ll make it all connect), our teacher taught us that there is acting, and there is acting &lt;i&gt;at&lt;/i&gt; something.  If someone is truly acting, the audience believes the actor is actually another character.  If someone is acting &lt;i&gt;at&lt;/i&gt; something, the audience can tell that they&#039;re watching an actor onstage pretending to be someone else.  Similarly, in music, there&#039;s a big difference between bands which pretend to play in a certain style and bands who know a certain style inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lettuce is the real deal.  Their brand of 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s funk and soul is almost indistinguishable from the music which made funk and soul so popular when it took the world by storm 50 years ago.  They groove, they&#039;re tight, they jam, their horns are killer…with Lettuce there is no pretence, no following fads - just 100% pure funky goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They played The Phoenix in February and, not having seen them live, I was sure to be in the audience. I was impressed by their playing, certainly; but I was also amazed by the breadth of the audience:  people of all ages, colours, shapes…there is something about funk and soul music which resonates with music aficionados and casual listeners alike.  Whether they were playing a tune with tight horn lines or stretching out, Lettuce kept the audience enthralled.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/J1IYY2tJMak?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That…just…feels…so…good.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their bio, on their new album &lt;i&gt;Fly&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;the pocket is deeper than ever.&quot; &quot;The pocket&quot; is one of those undefinable things (like &quot;swing&quot;) - I&#039;m not sure how to describe it, but I do know that without &quot;the pocket&quot;, the music just doesn&#039;t quite sit as well.  In my recent &lt;a href=&quot;/artistic-directors-guide-jazz-live-1&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz - Live!&lt;/a&gt; session with Larnell Lewis, he described it this way:  like with a pair of jeans, the pocket holds things.  The deeper the pocket, the more you can hold.  When it comes to Lettuce, having a deep pocket means all the various parts - the horn lines, the grooves, the feel - can all be held in one place.  Of course, it helps to have a guy like Adam Deitch on the drums, laying it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/QJU9cRHydJQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lettuce is currently on the road in support of their new album &lt;i&gt;Fly&lt;/i&gt;. Like many bands with new albums, they&#039;ve created a teaser trailer.  But unlike most other bands, the trailer has no words - not even any on-screen text.  They let the music speak for itself.  Which, to me, speaks volumes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/EgbhKcETmjE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lettuce performs on a double-bill with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band on Wednesday June 25, 8 pm on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C90F7D5CFAD&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/dirty-dozen-brass-band-lettuce&quot;&gt;visit the concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s gonna be groovy...&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rehandalal.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.rehandalal.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Rehan%20Dalal.jpg&quot; width=&quot;257&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rehan Dalal may be an unusual candidate for the role of a soul musician. He doesn&#039;t necessarily fit the traditional mold. Born and raised in Bombay, India, he grew up surrounded by Classic Rock cover bands, Bollywood singers and classical Indian musicians. However none of these sounds drew him in as strongly as the pulsing groove and earnest sentiments of Soul. After moving to Canada, he soon picked up a guitar and began writing songs. It was the start to an exciting journey that would find him finally making the music that he always found solace in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 25th, 2013 he released &quot;Got To Feel It&quot;, his debut record, produced by Justin Abedin (Justin Hines, jackSOUL). It is a collection of songs that touch upon a range of styles. Featuring soul stylings, R&amp;amp;B grooves, pop hooks and folk lyricism, Rehan&#039;s music is influenced by the early 60&#039;s soul sounds of Sam Cooke and Ray Charles; to the Motown era magic of Stevie Wonder and The Temptations; but also draws from more modern sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years he was won several awards and has garnered acclaim for his engaging live act. Performing at various festivals and sharing the stage with the likes of Divine Brown, Big Sugar and David Ryan Harris. He was even described as &quot;Really groovy&quot; by drummer Steve Jordan (John Mayer, Eric Clapton) and &quot;Very compelling&quot; by, Universal&#039;s head of A&amp;amp;R, Mark Spicoluk.&lt;/p&gt;

Having blown up stages from coast to coast last year, ranging from The Fillmore in SF to Terminal 5 in NYC, Bear Creek Music Festival to Camp Bisco and all points in-between, Lettuce entered Brooklyn recording studio The Bunker this winter with a fresh batch of road-tested material and a revitalized sound honed razor sharp by a year spent on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

To make CARNIVALE ELECTRICOS, the members of GALACTIC (Ben Ellman, harps and horns; Robert Mercurio, bass; Stanton Moore, drums and percussion; Jeff Raines, guitar; Rich Vogel, keyboards) draw on the skills, stamina, and funk they deploy in the all-night party of their annual Lundi Gras show that goes till sunrise and leads sleeplessly into Mardi Gras day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GALACTIC was formed eighteen years ago in New Orleans, and they cut their teeth playing the biggest party in America: Mardi Gras, when the town shuts down entirely to celebrate. CARNIVALE ELECTRICOS is beyond a party record. It’s a carnival record that evokes the electric atmosphere of a whole city – make that, whole cities – vibrating together all on the same day, from New Orleans all down the hemisphere to the mighty megacarnivals of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GALACTIC is, always was, and always will be a funk band. Whatever genre of music anyone in New Orleans is doing, from Mardi Gras Indians to rock bands to hardcore rappers, it’s all funk at the bottom, because funk is the common musical language, the lingua franca of New Orleans music.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Big Sam&#039;s Funky Nation</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigsamsfunkynation.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.bigsamsfunkynation.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/big-sam.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Sam’s Funky Nation is a driving force of urban funk. Ryan White, of the Oregonian, says the band is “tight enough (and hot enough) to turn coal into a diamond!” The band is led by trombone powerhouse, Big Sam Williams, formerly the trombonist for the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, who the San Francisco Chronicle calls “the top man on the slide trombone in the birthplace of jazz.” Big Sam refuses to let the audience sit still. Between the band’s solos, Big Sam’s signature dance moves and his distinctive trombone riffs, the energy level is high voltage when this band takes the stage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Funky Nation is a stellar group of world-class musicians who meet the challenges of their funky band leader. BSFN’s signature Noladelic Powerfunk sound masterfully combines a rock sensibility with improv-style associated with jazz and the horn-heavy front section that’s the hallmark of big band funk.Big Sam began playing with the Dirty Dozen at the tender age of 19 before striking out on his own and creating the Funky Nation. Big Sam powered-up the horn section on the critically acclaimed, Grammy nominated, “River in Reverse” and is prominently featured in &quot;Hot as a Pistol, Keen as a Blade&quot; the concert tour DVD. While touring with Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint, in the Fall of 2006 and Summer of 2007, he earned consistent reviews as a musical force and star soloist. Big Sam has played with Karl Denson’s Tiny Universe, Dave Matthews, Ozomatli, and Widespread Panic. He has also shared the stage with U2 and Green Day for the emotional and energetic re-opening of the Superdome which was broadcast live on Monday Night Football.&lt;/p&gt;

Inspired by his father (musician), Andrew fell in love with the inspirational soulful gospel and rhythm and blues music of the day. At 6 years old, with the guidance of his father, Andrew learned to play guitar and bass. By the time he was 8 he was copying bass lines and guitar licks he heard in church, on television, radio and from records. Influenced by great bass players such as Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, and Victor Wooten, Andrew decided to attend the internationally acclaimed jazz program at Humber College in 2000. There he studied with bassist Lenny Boyd and Even Tarleton. After a few semesters, with the encouragement of his teachers and his peers, he thought it was time to leave school and pursue a career in music full time. Since then Andrew has played in the studio and on stage with Salome Bey, Liberty Silver, Eddie Bullen, Michael Stuart, Robert Botos, Robert “Robbie” Greenidge, Kalabash, Pieces of a Dream, The Liamuiga Project and many others. He has also appeared on the television series “Soulfood” with Musiq Soulchild.&lt;/p&gt;
