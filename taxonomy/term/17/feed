 <title>What&#039;s so good about Bobby McFerrin</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-bobby-mcferrin</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/bobby-mcferrin-spirityouall&quot;&gt;Bobby McFerrin - spirityouall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I&#039;m supposed to go &quot;beyond the bio&quot; with these posts, but here&#039;s a line from Bobby McFerrin&#039;s bio which I think captures what makes him so special as an artist:  &quot;The 10-time Grammy winner has blurred the distinction between pop music and fine art, goofing around barefoot in the world’s finest concert halls, exploring uncharted vocal territory, inspiring a whole new generation of a cappella singers and the beatbox movement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with a musical master, a concert by Bobby McFerrin is so much more that just a concert - it&#039;s an experience. The instrument on display is certainly impressive - whether alone on stage or accompanied by a full orchestra, what he&#039;s able to do with his unique, multi-octave voice, beatboxing and body percussion is unmatched and enthralling. But for me, it&#039;s the rest of the package - the joy which emanates from the stage when he sings; the way in which he engages the audience - both through his stage persona and literally via audience participation - which makes Bobby McFerrin a must-see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than have me try to explain Bobby&#039;s approach to singing, check out this clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/81uJZIF9TCs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The clip above demonstrates Bobby&#039;s immense talent as a performer, but also  his commitment to sharing the joy of singing, and his passion for education.  It&#039;s apt that the video was taken on a day called Sing! Day of Song, in front of 60,000 other singers.  In his own words:  &quot;I try to sing the way I sing in my kitchen, because I just can’t help myself. I want audiences to leave the theatre and sing in their own kitchens the next morning. I want to bring audiences into the incredible feeling of joy and freedom I get when I sing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite videos of Bobby McFerrin I saw thanks to Facebook - someone posted it on their page.  It&#039;s not often that I include a video from the World Science Festival in the Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz…but I think you&#039;ll see why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ne6tB2KiZuk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a previous life, I managed a children&#039;s choir, and the Artistic Director always used to say &quot;If you can talk, you can sing.&quot; I feel Bobby McFerrin is always trying to remind us of the same idea.  We&#039;re not going to be able to do what he does, but we can share in the joy which he gets from singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his 2014 TD Toronto Jazz Festival appearance, he&#039;ll be performing music from his spirityouall project, in which he &quot;re-imagines Americana with beloved spirituals and original songs, raising the roof with joyful grooves.&quot; He&#039;ll have a full band with him on stage, but his voice will be on full display.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/eiEUaYd2MEg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I can&#039;t wait.  Bobby McFerrin - spirityouall performs Friday, June 27, 8 pm on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square.  Local soul extravaganza the Soul Nannies opens up.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C9000ABD377&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/bobby-mcferrin-spirityouall&quot;&gt;visit the concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Dianne Reeves?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-dianne-reeves</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/dianne-reeves&quot;&gt;Dianne Reeves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some artists, determining the focus of an AD&#039;s Guide entry is easy - one quality or focus stands out from the rest.  With an artist like Dianne Reeves, though, I&#039;m not sure where to start - I find her intriguing on so many levels:  her instrument, her approach to improvisation, the way she engages with the audience…she is an excellent example of the elusive &quot;complete package.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#039;t remember exactly where I first heard Dianne Reeves - it&#039;s possible that it was on the radio, perhaps a track from her recording &lt;i&gt;The Calling&lt;/i&gt;, celebrating the music of Sarah Vaughan.  As a big band leader, I was intrigued by the arrangements; but her voice drew me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it, exactly, about Dianne Reeves which intrigues me?  First, it&#039;s her instrument. As I&#039;ve mentioned in previous posts, it&#039;s silly perhaps to say &quot;this singer has a great voice&quot;…but with Dianne it holds true.  Hers is rich, full of colour and nuance - I feel I could listen to it all day.  Next it&#039;s her interpretation of melodies - she doesn&#039;t need to do much; with a subtle shift in rhythm here, a held note there, she makes each tune her own, whether a jazz standard or something more contemporary.  Then there&#039;s her approach to improvisation - Dianne never really gets flashy; she concentrates on quality over quality, ensuring her note choice is always tasty and satisfying.  Enough talk - here&#039;s a sample which demonstrates all of the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/84105061&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So - great voice, great interpretation, tasty improvisation…anything else?  Well, yes - Dianne Reeves is incredibly engaging, both on and off stage. The way she sings invites the audience in - from her first note to her last, the audience feels welcomed, and she radiates a joy from the stage. I had the pleasure of helping to produce a Dianne Reeves concert several years ago, and can confirm that she&#039;s just as welcoming behind the scenes - on the drive back to the hotel, she happily chatted about watching curling on the hotel television. No pretense, no attitude; instead the revelry about life in general which comes across in her singing. Here&#039;s a clip of a beautiful ballad, performed only with two guitars, which keeps the audience enraptured from beginning to end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/80445455&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For her new album, &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Life&lt;/i&gt;, Dianne has chosen songs which, according to her bio, &quot;have touched [my] spirit in different ways.&quot; Although the songs span a variety of styles - swing, R&amp;amp;B, soul, reggae - each has undeniably been made her own. In my mind, that is the mark of a true artist.  (You can see a short promo video about the new album &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/47YiHkWjWCg&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianne Reeves performs Tuesday, June 24 at 8 pm on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://torontojazz.com/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square.  Joining her on stage will be Romero Lubambo (guitar), Reginald Veal (bass) and Terreon Gully (drums); the Brandi Disterheft Quartet opens up.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C90EF0CCA53&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit her &lt;a href=&quot;http://torontojazz.com/concert/dianne-reeves&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And now she returns with her new opus, &quot;I Remember When&quot;, showing her vocal skills yet again. This time she chooses songs by the likes of Eminem, John Legend and Kanye West, taking them into her own world of jazz, soul and hip hop while adding a few classics (Gladys Knight) and the quirky title &quot;And So We Dance&quot; (aka &quot;Alors on danse&quot; in Stromae&#039;s original version)&lt;/p&gt;

Her solo CDs have garnered her multiple nominations for Latin Jazz Performer of the Year, and her songs have appeared on three Putumayo world music collections: Bossanova Around the World, Latin Dreamland and most recently, Cafe Latino. Her third and latest CD “Mañana” was helmed by GRAMMY-winning producer Javier Limón and is set for release in 2013. Limón, whose production credits include acclaimed singers such as Buika, Mariza and Diego el Cigala, hails Martinez as “one of the greatest voices in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martinez has headlined at the legendary Blue Note jazz club, at the 2010 FIFA World Cup Festivities in South Africa, and at the 2011 PanAmerican Games in Guadalajara, and is now honorary co-chair of PanAm 2015’s Ignite program. She will be performing in a series of countdown concerts to the 2015 Games, as well as speaking at events connecting athletes and sports fans with musicians and art lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to her music career, Amanda has worked as a radio host (launching Canada’s JAZZFM91 Latin Jazz program), TV personality (BRAVO Arts &amp;amp; Minds, Star TV!) and actress (Regnesis and Disney’s Life with Derek). She is also an ambassador for SOS Children’s Villages, a global organization that helps abandoned and orphaned siblings stay united as families. A young mother of three, Martinez calls the SOS mission “a cause close to my heart.” &lt;/p&gt;

She’s opened for the Rolling Stones, headlined at the Chicago Blues Festival and numerous festivals around the world, scored critics choice awards on both sides of the Atlantic (The New York Times and The Times of London), shared the stage with such luminaries as Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Mick Jagger, and Eric Clapton, and has even performed at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama. Heir to the rich tradition of soul-drenched divas like Ruth Brown, Etta James and Koko Taylor, the singer was presented with Taylor’s crown by her daughter, Cookie, on June 12, 2011 at the Chicago Blues Festival and given the honor of the new “Queen of the Blues” by official proclamation of the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copeland’s passion for singing, matched with her huge, blast-furnace voice, gives her music a timeless power and a heart-pounding urgency. Her music comes from deep within her soul and from the streets where she grew up, surrounded by the everyday sounds of the city – street performers, gospel singers, blasting radios, bands in local parks and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

Her powerful voice, unforgettable stage charisma, and timeless compositions have made her a rising star in Nova Scotia’s vibrant music scene. Fronting a band that features six of Halifax’s best musicians, Cyndi draws musical roots from her early childhood singing gospel music in church. Her music evokes the classic soul and r&amp;amp;b sounds of Sharon Jones, Aretha Franklin and Bettye LaVette. Cyndi is rapidly gaining recognition as a force in Canada’s music community, and she is not slowing down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyndi has shared the stage with the likes of Charles Bradley, Michael Buble, Symphony Nova Scotia, Naturally 7, Dutch Mason and in 2010 was selected to perform for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. She is an African Nova Scotia Music Award winner for Artist of the Year (2014) and Best R&amp;amp;B Artist (2000), and won the Galaxy Rising Star Award for her stellar performance at 2011 Halifax Jazz Festival. She has studied Musical Theatre at Sheridan College, Toronto, and for several years honed her live chops fronting a popular Motown revue in venues in the US, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyndi recently released her second full length album “Soul Food” (Independent, 2013) to rave reviews. The album is a collection of 13 original songs that run the gamut from heart-breakers to party starters. Her backing band supports her with stellar arrangements and sweet grooves and at every moment her talent shines through. Cyndi plays a unique role within the East Coast music community as her band is one of the only musical groups writing and performing original soul and r&amp;amp;b music in the Maritimes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyndi’s repertoire for this tour will consist entirely of original material from her new album plus selected songs from her debut album “Essentially Cyndi”. Her music represents a high water mark for new, original Canadian soul.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dianne Reeves</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diannereeves.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.diannereeves.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Reevesweb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dianne Reeves&#039; most recent release, Beautiful Life, showcases Reeves’ sublime gifts by melding elements of R&amp;amp;B, Latin and pop within the framework of 21st Century jazz. “At its essence,” says Reeves, “Life is beautiful and I wanted to celebrate that which is too often overlooked.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album simmers and smolders throughout, starting off with a mesmerizing makeover of the Marvin Gaye classic, “I Want You.” The choice for this song was influenced by the music Reeves grew up listening to at a time when categories and boundaries were not as finite as they are today. Reeves says, “I always loved Marvin Gaye. Not just because he was a great singer, but because his music was soul steeped in jazz.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Robert Glasper, Reeves breathes new life into Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams, and delivers a beautiful rendition of the rock classic that is haunting and suspenseful. While Ani Difranco’s self-empowering “32 Flavors” had been in Reeves’ live repertoire for some time, this is the first time she has recorded it—and the result is a rousing anthem. “The song is about people doing amazing things that nobody sees,” says Reeves.  “It speaks to how we should be more conscious about those around us—those who populate and contribute to our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also included is a brilliant version of Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler’s standard, “Stormy Weather,” a song that harkens back to Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Billie Holiday—all of whom brought the song mainstream and put their stamp on it—and with an openness and floating sense of time, Reeves has now done the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Marley’s “Waiting in Vain” is another jewel in Beautiful Life onto which Reeves has made all her own. “When I brought this amazing song to my friend, Brazilian guitarist Romero Lubambo, he worked his magic on the arrangement and I couldn’t wait to sing it,” Reeves enthused. The result is thoroughly entrancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIANNE REEVES is among the pre-eminent jazz vocalists in the world. A multiple Grammy-winner, Reeves has recorded and performed extensively with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra featuring Wynton Marsalis, who said of Reeves, “She has one of the most powerful, purposeful and accurate voices of this or any time.” Reeves has also recorded with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Daniel Barenboim and was a featured soloist with Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic. In addition, she was the first Creative Chair for Jazz for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the first singer to ever perform at the famed Walt Disney Concert Hall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reeves worked with legendary producer Arif Mardin (Norah Jones, Aretha Franklin) on the Grammy winning A Little Moonlight, an intimate collection of standards. When Reeves’ holiday collection Christmas Time is Here was released, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times raved, “Ms. Reeves, a jazz singer of frequently astonishing skill, takes the assignment seriously; this is one of the best jazz Christmas CD&#039;s I&#039;ve heard.”  Reeves was featured in George Clooney’s six-time Academy Award nominated “Good Night, and Good Luck,” and performed every song on the Grammy-winning soundtrack which was released on Concord Jazz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, Reeves has toured the world in a variety of contexts including a program entitled “Sing the Truth,” a musical celebration of Nina Simone in which Lizz Wright and Angelique Kidjo were also featured.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what has been a storied, extraordinary career, Beautiful Life features some of the most engaging songs Reeves’ has ever offered. “Even in a world with much sadness,” says Reeves, “at its essence, life is beautiful and I wanted to celebrate that which can be easily overlooked.” Most certainly, among those things not to be overlooked is Beautiful Life.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Toronto Mass Choir</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmc.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.tmc.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/MassChoir_Image.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Toronto Mass Choir (TMC) continues to be on the cutting edge of the Canadian gospel music scene bringing their distinct gospel sound to the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMC’s music incorporates contemporary gospel, traditional gospel and Caribbean music influences. In particular TMC’s combination of gospel lyrics with a variety of musical styles has resulted in a style unique in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeds of this traveling ministry were sown during the choir’s initial recording session in October 1988. The choir’s debut album, Great Is Thy Glory, released in April 1990 on the Micah Communications label was re-released as The Early Years. TMC’s second live recording, God is our Hope was released in 1994, followed in April 1998 by its Juno nominated album, Follow Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2002, Instrument of Praise was released.  That year the Gospel Music Association Canada (GMAC) awarded TMC a Covenant Award for Best Urban/Contemporary Gospel Album of the Year.  In 2003, they picked up a Juno Award for Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year; the Vibe Award for Urban/Soul Album of the Year, and the Urban Music Association of Canada Award for Gospel Recording of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2005, the choir broke new ground, using a 20-piece orchestra on The Live Experience, which also garnered a GMAC, Covenant Award in 2006 for Traditional Gospel Album of the Year. A Shai Award, the gospel music people’s choice prize, for Urban/Soul album of the year followed in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September 2007 release of Going Home, a full Caribbean gospel album, showcased the choir’s soulful style of reggae, calypso, ska and new sounds with the fusion of jazz and reggae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of their seventh album in 2010, A Christmas Gift marked the first Contemporary Gospel Choir Christmas CD release in Canada and showcases TMC at its best.  A Christmas Gift also won 2 Covenant Music awards including ‘Seasonal Album of the Year’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, as they entered their 25th performance season, Toronto Mass Choir released ‘25’, a CD featuring highlights from over their recording career as well as 4 previously unreleased songs from their early years. That same year, TMC was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Gospel Music Association of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Burke, a graduate of McMaster University, the Royal Conservatory of Music and a Professor of music at York University, is the director of the diversified group of singers and musicians along with her husband, Oswald Burke, who is their Executive Producer. “Toronto Mass Choir is proof that Gospel music is alive and well in Canada and it is has been our privilege to share the Good News of the Gospel for almost 25 years,” said Burke. Burke also conducts numerous gospel music workshops in Canada and internationally. TMC’s official 25th anniversary is October 15, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now 35-strong plus a four-piece band, the not for profit choir consists of adult members who are from various local church denominations including Baptist, Church of God, Wesleyan, Missionary, and Pentecostal.&lt;/p&gt;
