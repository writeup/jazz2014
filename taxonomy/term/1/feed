&lt;p&gt;Four-time Grammy™ winner Stanley Clarke is quite possibly the most celebrated acoustic and electric bassist in the world. As a performer, composer, conductor, arranger, recording artist, producer, and film scorer known for his ferocious dexterity and consummate musicality, Clarke is a true pioneer in jazz and of the bass itself. Unquestionably he is a “living legend,” lauded with every conceivable award available to a musician in his over 40-year career as a bass virtuoso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication is paramount. The vibe on &lt;i&gt;Wah-Wah&lt;/i&gt; relies heavily on interplay, phrasing and playing unison lines, and communication in improvisation. One of the keys to the success of this risk-taking album is the compositions, that showcase Waldorff’s talent for wedding melody to sophisticated harmonic structures and different styles. Waldorff’s melodic gifts as an improviser are on full display throughout the album and in concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I needed to make a change and put myself in front of this music, and see where I could go with it,” Waldorff says. “To go out front and carry the melodic role really made me able to play and get something said. Communication in music has become even more the center of where I want to go, along with risk-taking, and that’s where I will go with music from here.”&lt;/p&gt;

Inspired by his father (musician), Andrew fell in love with the inspirational soulful gospel and rhythm and blues music of the day. At 6 years old, with the guidance of his father, Andrew learned to play guitar and bass. By the time he was 8 he was copying bass lines and guitar licks he heard in church, on television, radio and from records. Influenced by great bass players such as Jaco Pastorius, Stanley Clarke, and Victor Wooten, Andrew decided to attend the internationally acclaimed jazz program at Humber College in 2000. There he studied with bassist Lenny Boyd and Even Tarleton. After a few semesters, with the encouragement of his teachers and his peers, he thought it was time to leave school and pursue a career in music full time. Since then Andrew has played in the studio and on stage with Salome Bey, Liberty Silver, Eddie Bullen, Michael Stuart, Robert Botos, Robert “Robbie” Greenidge, Kalabash, Pieces of a Dream, The Liamuiga Project and many others. He has also appeared on the television series “Soulfood” with Musiq Soulchild.&lt;/p&gt;
