 <title>What&#039;s so good about Hiromi?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-hiromi-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/hiromi-trio-project&quot;&gt;Hiromi:  The Trio Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is subjective, and so it should come as no surprise that for me, some artists resonate from the first note I hear, while others take a little more time to sink in.  For me, Hiromi Uehara falls into the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before spending some time listening to Hiromi, I knew she was an exciting and popular pianist.  Hers is one name mentioned frequently when we ask our audience which artists they&#039;d like to see at the festival; her performance on the mainstage in 2012 was high-energy from start to finish.  I didn&#039;t have a sense, though, of her true mastery not only of her instrument, but of her ability to represent on the piano the wide range of emotions which inspire her each time she plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiromi arrived on the international jazz scene in 2003, having been signed to the Telarc label even before completing her studies at Berklee College of Music.  She was quickly recognized as a monster pianist, and clips like this one demonstrate how well she moves around the 88 keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/-HcKrd3K8_A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fiery technique is certainly key to creating an exciting performance...but it&#039;s the more subtle moments that tend to really connect me to what I&#039;m hearing.  If an artist can maintain my interest in the quiet (but no less intense) moments, then I start to feel like I&#039;m in the presence of a master.  Here&#039;s a great example:  in this performance of her tune &quot;Place to Be&quot;, I notice Hiromi&#039;s delicate touch on the keys and the emotion coming across in her playing but also, when she moves into the solo section (right around 3:35), there&#039;s a sense of groove - appropriate to the tune, but swinging all the same.  Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/LKuEJBKRW4M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hiromi will be joined onstage by Anthony Jackson on bass and Simon Phillips on drums; their performance will feature music from the soon-to-be-released &lt;i&gt;Alive&lt;/i&gt;. The trio has been together for four years; &lt;i&gt;Alive&lt;/i&gt; is their third album. As a result, this is an extremely cohesive unit - they are able to play together and respond to each other in unique ways.  As Hiromi says:  &quot;That&#039;s the great thing about having a working trio: We understand how to make each other shine.&quot;  If this track is any indication, the new album is going to continue their high-energy tradition:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Jon Ballantyne?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-jon-ballantyne</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/jon-ballantyne&quot;&gt;Jon Ballantyne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pianist Jon Ballantyne is a bit hard to pin down - and that&#039;s a good thing.  Equally comfortable playing in small groups or solo; inside the changes or far out; standards or original compositions, Jon always makes each tune, and each solo, his own. A quick look at his performance history demonstrates why he moves smoothly among styles.  He&#039;s shared the stage with more straightahead players like Woody Herman, Barry Harris, Joe Henderson and Joe Lovano, and also with stalwarts of the more improvisation-based side of jazz like Dewey Redman, Dave Liebman, Kenny Wheeler and Cecil Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no small feat to be truly at home across musical styles.  I feel Jon&#039;s playing exudes a confidence which comes only from delving deeply into each style.  In a group setting, his soloing reflects his influences while still being true to the tune being performed - even with a large vocabulary from which to choose, Jon makes beautiful musical choices.  Here&#039;s a sample - an excerpted solo from a quartet performance.  I like the journey the solo takes - I hear some straight-ahead playing, some Thelonious Monk, and flashes of a player who can easily take things outside as required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/X93MGES_r10?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is perhaps in a solo setting though that Jon&#039;s brilliance is most on display. (His solo album &lt;i&gt;Avenue Standard&lt;/i&gt; won a 2007 JUNO Award.) Just as he has mastered various musical styles, he has mastered the art of playing solo.  He knows how to get the most orchestral sounds out of the piano, and which notes to play when, making it easy to forget there is only one musician on stage.  Playing his original solo compositions - or a solo spontaneous improvisation - Jon is also perhaps at his most creative. Without a standard set of chord changes (or even chord changes at all), he&#039;s able to take listeners on a unique journey.  We may not be sure where we&#039;ll end up, but we can be assured of a smooth landing.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;236&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/92kqnlGz6lk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a recent Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz - Live! session, I asked Bill King about what separates the pianists who &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; play solo from those that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; soloists.  He had lots to say on the matter (you can hear the full session &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/artistic-directors-guide-jazz-live-bill-king&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but what stuck out in particular was his suggestion that great piano soloists know how to use the whole piano - from the very top to the very bottom - and some of the best examples of great piano soloists were stride players.  The stride style of playing - with the left hand constantly moving from bass note to chordal accompaniment - required an intimate knowledge of when notes in all registers would sound best.  It is perhaps no surprise then that, among the styles in which Jon Ballantyne comfortably performs, is stride piano.  Here&#039;s a sample which starts off stride-ish, then travels in a whole new direction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/8JRRnP99CSw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jon Ballantyne performs solo on Tuesday, June 24, 8 pm at &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/jazz-bistro&quot;&gt;Jazz Bistro&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C9200D9741E&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit his &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/jon-ballantyne-solo-piano&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s sure to be a great ride!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What the heck is Mehliana?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/what-heck-mehliana</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/mehliana&quot;&gt;Mehliana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short, factual answer:  Mehliana is the combination of pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Mark Guiliana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short, opinionated answer:  Mehliana is awesomesauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that the combination of two heavyweight artists would produce new, creative and exciting music. Brad Mehldau and Mark Guiliana are each highly acclaimed for their own variety of projects.  Brad is most frequently seen with his trio, but he&#039;s also played regularly with Joshua Redman, Pat Metheny and others. Mark Guiliana was the drummer with bassist Avishai Cohen for eight years, and has played with artists ranging from Meshell Ndegeocello to Matisyahu to Bobby McFerrin. Mehliana puts on display some of the musical and technical approaches for which each musician is recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A duo of piano and drums is rare, but when these two creative musicians get together any challenges which might arise from the unique instrumentation disappear. Rather than trying to force their instruments into one style or another, I feel they are capitalizing on what each instrument does best.  More often than not, that means great grooves from Mark, and great melodic soloing from Brad.  Here&#039;s a taste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/tn6gjoMUEY4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A couple of other points come to mind when I hear Mehliana play.  First, Brad and Mark are well-equipped to tackle complex rhythmic and harmonic playing.  If you want a polyrhythmic, super-imposed tuplet of one sort or another or a slash chord with all of the extensions, they could easily give you that.  But Mehliana is not the outlet for that kind of playing.  Instead, they seem to be concentrating on making music more reminiscent  of dance music.  Longer, groove based jams.  They still throw in a fancy lick here and there, but audiences of all kinds should be able to listen and bop along.  Of course, it takes two master musicians to sustain interest in tunes which tend to be longer than standard radio play - but there are no worries on that front with these two. Through multiple listenings of the album I continue to be intrigued. And, as we&#039;ll see with the track below, you never know where a longer tune might take you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/cnH27mxW0KM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Mehliana&#039;s recently-released CD, &lt;i&gt;Taming the Dragon&lt;/i&gt;, features twelve compositions - six by the duo, and six by Brad Mehldau.  And in this case, composition means many things:  melody and harmony, as usual; but as we&#039;ve seen in the video samples above, they have also thought about how to expand the sonic landscape available to them.  By incorporating synthesizers, pedals, effects, drum machines and other electronics, they have a huge palette from which to choose.  And they use it to great effect.  One more example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Mrokp2Pmapg?list=RDtn6gjoMUEY4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With Mehliana we&#039;re sure to get a mix of composed music and improvisation; a great mix of styles, from street beat to drum and bass to funk and jazz-rock; and a driving, synth-laden, melodic musical treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehliana performs on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square on Saturday, June 28 at 8 pm, on a double-bill with the Stanley Clarke Trio.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C90040ED514&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/mehliana-stanley-clarke-trio&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Following four years as a bandsman in the U.S. Navy Bill spent 15 years as a session player in the Hollywood studios. In 1984 he re-located to New York City, firmly establishing himself as an in-demand sideman and leader of his own ensembles. He has worked with jazz legends Benny Golson, Red Mitchell, Gerry Mulligan, Bud Shank, Frank Sinatra, The Vanguard Jazz Orchestra,&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah Vaughan and Phil Woods. His many recordings (solo, duo, trio and sextet) are well-documented on the Chiaroscuro, Concord, Palmetto and Steeplechase record labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prolific composer and arranger, Mays has written extended works for bass, flute, woodwind septet as well as pieces for big band and orchestra. Bill’s latest recordings are “Phil &amp;amp; Bill” (with saxophonist Phil Woods), “Side By Side: Sondheim Duos” (with bassist Tommy Cecil) and “Life’s A Movie” (The Inventions Trio, with cellist Alisa Horn and trumpeter Marvin Stamm). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Mays -- beyond category. With deep roots in jazz, gospel, pop and classical music his eclectic, prolific career as pianist, composer and arranger spans five decades. On hundreds of recordings, TV and movie soundtracks, Bill&#039;s concert and studio credits include a who&#039;s who of modern music, from Benny Golson to Gerry Mulligan to Sarah Vaughan to Frank Zappa.&lt;/p&gt;

He burst onto the scene in the early 60s, first with Charles Lloyd and then with Miles Davis. He went on to launch a prolific solo career marked by several phases and rich collaborations. Jarrett&#039;s improvisational solo concerts from the 1970s are widely viewed as classics. He has also made scores of straight-up jazz recordings with his trio as well as classical recordings. Keith Jarrett enjoys a virtual cult following all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon’s early interest in studying and performing music ultimately led to his playing and/or recording with some of the finest jazz musicians of our time, including Joe Henderson, Paul Bley, Dewey Redman, Seamus Blake, Billy Hart, Roy Haynes, Ingrid Jensen, Phil Woods, Gene Perla, Drew Gress, Dave Liebman, Alan Jones, Donny McAslin, Bill Goodwin, Don Thompson, Phil Dwyer, Joe Lovano and Mark Turner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his formative years, Jon performed with Pepper Adams, toured with Woody Herman’s Thundering Herd, and recorded and toured with Terry Clarke, Neil Swainson and Jerry Fuller. During this period, Jon also studied and in many cases played with greats like Cecil Taylor, Ed Blackwell, Kenny Wheeler, Elvin Jones, Barry Harris, Richard Beirach, Joanne Brackeen, Emily Remler and Lee Konitz, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a performance career spanning almost three decades, Jon has toured in Japan, a great deal of Western Europe, the UK and Ireland, all provinces in Canada as well as 40 US States. Jon has performed in some of the world’s finest concert halls such as the Cremona, Italy Opera House; Kilbourn Hall-Eastman School of Music and Place des Arts-Montreal; and some of the world’s finest art institutions including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Stockholm. He has also performed at highly regarded jazz clubs like Birdland and the Knitting Factory in New York, and the Deer Head Inn in Northeastern Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Jon’s much lauded solo piano concerts in the 21st century have been the tours and recordings undertaken with his critically acclaimed quartet featuring bassist Boris Kozlov, drummer Jeff Hirshfield and saxophonist/bass clarinetist Douglas Yates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether he’s performing his original compositions-which can be knotty and dense, or sometimes quiet, spacey and melodic-two-handed virtuosic improvisations, or reworking the standard jazz repertoire, Jon’s sense of openness, daring originality and inborn creativity always inform his playing, much to the delight of his listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gerald Clayton</title>

Hailed by The New York Times for his &quot;huge, authoritative presence,&quot; Clayton is well on his way toward etching his own enduring mark in the long and rich tradition of jazz. Never has this been more apparent than in Life Forum, his latest recording on Concord Jazz and his most ambitious project to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in the Netherlands in 1984 and raised in Southern California, Clayton took his first piano lessons before age seven with the full support and encouragement of his father, the acclaimed jazz bassist, composer and bandleader, John Clayton. Music was a central part of his life from as long as he can remember and it became a lifetime commitment very early on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was in the third grade, and there was a talent show where I played a boogie-woogie piece that my dad had written for me,&quot; he recalls. &quot;It was the first time that I played for an audience where I felt that people were really moved by something that I had just played. I remember thinking, ´Yep, this is what I´ll be doing for the rest of my life.´&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clayton attended the L.A. County High School for the Arts and then enrolled at the USC Thornton School of Music. In the midst of his third year at USC, he temporarily relocated to New York to study at the Manhattan School of Music.  In 2006, Gerald received the second place prize in the prestigious Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz Piano Competition. Around that time, he was introduced to trumpeter Roy Hargrove when they were both featured artists at a performance of the Henry Mancini Orchestra. &quot;We were backstage during one of the rehearsals, and we started playing some duets,&quot; recalls Clayton. &quot;After that I would see him from time to time in New York, and he would say, ´Great that you´re in New York now. I´ll call you.´ That was how things started.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association resulted in three years of extensive touring with Hargrove between 2006 and 2009, and appearances on Hargrove´s recordings. Gerald also appeared on recordings by several other artists, such as Diana Krall, Ambrose Akinmusire, Kendrick Scott, Melissa Morgan, Terell Stafford &amp;amp; Dick Oatts, and more recently Michael Rodriguez, Dayna Stephens, Terri Lyne Carrington, and the Clayton Brothers Quintet, led by his father and his uncle, saxophonist Jeff Clayton. Gerald continues to perform regularly with the Clayton Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, he released Two Shade, his debut album as a leader, with bassist Joe Sanders and drummer Justin Brown. Sanders and Brown have remained with him for his two subsequent records. It was from this recording that Gerald received a 2010 Grammy nomination in the category of ´Best Improvised Jazz Solo´ for his rendition of Cole Porter´s &quot;All of You.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Gerald received a second Grammy nomination, this time for ´Best Jazz Instrumental Composition´, for his piece &quot;Battle Circle&quot; featured on the Clayton Brothers recording, The New Song and Dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year, Clayton released his second album, Bond: The Paris Sessions. Bond received a Grammy nomination, Gerald´s third, in 2012 for ´Best Jazz Instrumental Album´.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Forum, released in 2013, &quot;might be the most ambitious album yet,&quot; states Clayton. &quot;Conceptualizing the music for a group of eight musicians was a new experience for me, and it required more preparation than I was accustomed to. With the addition of lyrics to three of the tunes, as well as some other post-production work, this project has been a departure from my previous two. I´m doing more writing now than I´ve ever done before, and working with Ben Wendel, who produced the record, was very helpful. I really admire his playing and his writing. He and I got together prior to the sessions to talk about the music and map out what I needed to do to get it recorded. In that sense, it was more demanding than the previous records.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What comes after Life Forum is anyone´s guess,&quot; says Clayton, who does not want to be defined by any one musical tradition: &quot;I prefer to ignore the boxes, the genre distinctions,&quot; he says. &quot;I focus on creating honest musical expressions and collaborating with people whose ideas resonate with my own.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

He has been cited, along with Mark Murphy and Kurt Elling, as one of the world’s finest male jazz vocalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Welsh vocalist remains the gentlest of troubadours and most nakedly magical of storytellers… [A Ghost In Every Bar] is a marvelous journey through one of the superlative, if vastly underappreciated, songbooks of the past century&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
