 <title>What&#039;s so good about Joey DeFrancesco?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-joey-defrancesco</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/joey-defrancesco&quot;&gt;Joey DeFrancesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m trying to figure out where exactly my love of the Hammond B3 organ sound comes from.  I didn&#039;t grow up listening to blues or gospel; I went to synagogue, not church; and my record collection is more big band and trumpet than keys.  But somewhere along the way, I took out a Jimmy Smith CD from the library and something clicked.  Since then, a well-played gospelly, bluesy organ has resonated somewhere deep within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we&#039;re going to talk about Hammond B3 organ, we must talk about Joey DeFrancesco.  Essentially, Joey DeFrancesco encapsulates in his playing everything that comes to mind when I think about great organ:  he swings like crazy; his vocabulary includes all of the blues and gospel licks which sound so great on the instrument; and his playing exudes the sense of fun for which I feel the instrument may have been created. Let&#039;s launch right in to a track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/dFcVaitADW8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In that one track, he shows off what&#039;s made him one of the best in the world: gospelly goodness off the top, great blues licks, and technical virtuosity.  What you might not have noticed - especially if you haven&#039;t seen many organists play live - is what&#039;s happening underneath the keyboard. While his hands are busy playing the chords and melodies (and soloing), Joey&#039;s feet are busy holding down the bass line.  I don&#039;t know enough about how organists train to suggest that all organists learn this skill; what I do know - having seen a few - is that not all organists use their feet in performance. Just another notch in the &quot;complete package&quot; column for DeFrancesco! Here&#039;s a clip demonstrating his fancy footwork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/XfolH2D-ZzI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Any great musician - and any great combo - knows exactly when to ratchet up the tension or the excitement in a performance.  For me, somehow the sound of the organ heightens that musical tension even more.  Maybe it&#039;s the  way certain chords sound and feel especially crunchy - so when they resolve, the resolution is particularly satisfactory. I&#039;m not sure.  What I do know is that Joey DeFrancesco understands perfectly how to create and release musical tension, and how best to use the instrument to his advantage. Here&#039;s a clip of two organ masters - Joey along with Dr. Lonnie Smith - which demonstrates two different styles of organ playing:&lt;/p&gt;

Joey DeFrancesco takes the stage along with Jeff Parker (guitar) and George Fludas (drums) on June 25, 8 pm at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91BE51B7A7&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit his &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/joey-defrancesco-trio&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Nels Cline and Julian Lage?  Really?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/nels-cline-and-juian-lage-really</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/nels-cline&quot;&gt;Nels Cline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first blush, it may seem like an odd combination - a guitarist perhaps best known for playing in a rock band, but whose experience in jazz, punk and experimental music goes back decades; teaming up with a relative newcomer on the scene with an affinity for a more traditional approach. Having seen them perform together, though, I can assure you - they make beautiful music together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any musical partnership requires that each player have open years, and be able to react to what the other is doing.  Happily, the respective experience of these two particular guitarists lends itself well to an open-eared collaboration.  Nels Cline has made a name for himself performing in settings which require maximum flexibility - in his own Nels Cline Singers, with musicians like Tim Berne, Jim Black, Charlie Haden and Yoko Ono, and even with painter Norton Wisdom for a project called Stained Radiance. Julian Lage, recognized as a child prodigy, was taken under Gary Burton&#039;s wing but over the past several years has explored broad musical horizons for his own albums and in projects with Fred Hersch, Mark O&#039;Connor, John Patitucci, Bela Fleck and others.  The result is a mix of their various influences.  Here&#039;s a relatively straight-ahead sample which shows off some of the technique which has earned each guitarist acclaim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/BP1tFOcQA9c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Chops aside, though, to me the most interesting aspect of the duo is the musical travels their performances take.  I didn&#039;t really know about Nels Cline until recently when a colleague raved about him (I admit to not knowing much about Wilco); Julian Lage could (though less now) be classified as an emerging artist.  So when I saw the duo perform at Winter Jazzfest in New York in 2012, I wasn&#039;t exactly sure what to expect, other than &quot;this should probably be good.&quot;  It ended up being a highlight of the weekend for me.  When Lage and Cline perform together, they mix composition with spontaneous improvisation; groove-based playing with more ethereal textures; blues licks with what could be classical excerpts.  The result is unexpected, fascinating, and a joyful ride.  Here&#039;s another clip - this one travels a bit further afield than the first example above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/o9bt2AnT0eU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A concert featuring fully improvised music requires a different investment from an audience - there must be a willingness to suspend pre-conceived notions of melody and harmony, and to just go along for the ride. What reassures me, when I&#039;m entering into a less-familiar musical situation as an audience member, is the knowledge that the music will be performed at a high level. Nels Cline has been hailed by &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; as one of the top 100 guitarists of all time, while Julian Lage was recently a winner in the &lt;i&gt;Downbeat Magazine&lt;/i&gt; &quot;Rising Star Guitar&quot; category.  So you will be in good musical hands when these two take the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to find online a (somewhat shaky) recording of that Winter Jazzfest show which impressed me so - here&#039;s a clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/-G5XmSRlt64?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Nels Cline/Julian Lage Duo performs at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, June 24 at 10 pm.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91BD47B693&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/nels-cline-julian-lage-duo&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Hiromi?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-hiromi-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/hiromi-trio-project&quot;&gt;Hiromi:  The Trio Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is subjective, and so it should come as no surprise that for me, some artists resonate from the first note I hear, while others take a little more time to sink in.  For me, Hiromi Uehara falls into the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before spending some time listening to Hiromi, I knew she was an exciting and popular pianist.  Hers is one name mentioned frequently when we ask our audience which artists they&#039;d like to see at the festival; her performance on the mainstage in 2012 was high-energy from start to finish.  I didn&#039;t have a sense, though, of her true mastery not only of her instrument, but of her ability to represent on the piano the wide range of emotions which inspire her each time she plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiromi arrived on the international jazz scene in 2003, having been signed to the Telarc label even before completing her studies at Berklee College of Music.  She was quickly recognized as a monster pianist, and clips like this one demonstrate how well she moves around the 88 keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/-HcKrd3K8_A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fiery technique is certainly key to creating an exciting performance...but it&#039;s the more subtle moments that tend to really connect me to what I&#039;m hearing.  If an artist can maintain my interest in the quiet (but no less intense) moments, then I start to feel like I&#039;m in the presence of a master.  Here&#039;s a great example:  in this performance of her tune &quot;Place to Be&quot;, I notice Hiromi&#039;s delicate touch on the keys and the emotion coming across in her playing but also, when she moves into the solo section (right around 3:35), there&#039;s a sense of groove - appropriate to the tune, but swinging all the same.  Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/LKuEJBKRW4M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hiromi will be joined onstage by Anthony Jackson on bass and Simon Phillips on drums; their performance will feature music from the soon-to-be-released &lt;i&gt;Alive&lt;/i&gt;. The trio has been together for four years; &lt;i&gt;Alive&lt;/i&gt; is their third album. As a result, this is an extremely cohesive unit - they are able to play together and respond to each other in unique ways.  As Hiromi says:  &quot;That&#039;s the great thing about having a working trio: We understand how to make each other shine.&quot;  If this track is any indication, the new album is going to continue their high-energy tradition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/kR8HinFaQhk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hiromi:  The Trio Project takes the stage at &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/koerner-hall&quot;&gt;Koerner Hall&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, June 24 at 8 pm.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://tickets.rcmusic.ca/public/hall.asp?event=1154&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/hiromi-trio-project&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Roy Hargrove?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-roy-hargrove-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/roy-hargrove-quintet&quot;&gt;Roy Hargrove Quintet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, I must reveal my bias.  I&#039;m a trumpet player.  And so any other trumpet player with outstanding sound and technique is going to rank fairly high on my list.  But that&#039;s not all that&#039;s good about Roy Hargrove...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick look at some of Hargrove&#039;s acclaimed projects reveals the breadth of his ability.  He won Grammy awards in 1997 (Best Latin Jazz Performance with his Cuban-based band Crisol) and 2002 (Best Instrumental Jazz Album for his contribution to &lt;i&gt;Directions in Music&lt;/i&gt;, the Herbie Hancock-led tribute to Miles Davis and John Coltrane).  In 2003 he introduced the world to his funk/hip-hop/jazz collective the RH Factor; and in 2010 he appeared at the TD Toronto Jazz Festival fronting a big band.  It could be said that every album he&#039;s released has been different from the previous album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things appeal to me in particular about Roy&#039;s playing.  First is his sound.  Oftentimes when a player&#039;s technique is discussed, what&#039;s being referred to is his or her ability to easily get around the instrument - high, low, fast, slow.  Roy&#039;s got that ability, but he&#039;s also got incredible control over his sound.  It&#039;s beautiful, round and full, but in the middle of an intense solo, he easily converts it to a fiery force with which to be reckoned.  Second is his ability to truly tell a story when soloing.  With Roy it seems to not be all about technique - he builds on each phrase, extending it out to complete a musical paragraph.  Check it out (Roy&#039;s solo starts at about 5:38):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/jCatQQL6cds&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The third thing I notice about Roy&#039;s playing is how funky it is.  In a group like the RH Factor, that may be expected; but even in his quintet, Roy not only swings - he grooves.  Here&#039;s a track that demonstrates these various aspects:  the melody shows off the ease with which he gets around the horn; his solo (which starts at about 4:15) starts off simply but then builds to a fever pitch, showing off his range of sound; and the whole thing just grooves like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/qxeb0cwjE8U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We talk a lot these days about the cross-over between jazz and hip-hop, and there are a number of musicians who have garnered attention for recent &quot;genre-bending&quot; albums.  A mix of jazz, gospel, funk and hip-hop has been a part of Roy Hargrove&#039;s playing and composing for years; with projects like the RH Factor he has explicitly explored the relationship between jazz and other genres.  These musical explorations, coupled with his technique on the instrument, has inspired a generation of musicians. Here he is talking a bit about the evolution of jazz - from swing to hip hop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/6z1ChouasFU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Roy Hargrove Quintet (Roy along with Justin Robinson on alto sax &amp;amp; flute, Sullivan Fortner on piano, Ameem Saleem on bass, and Quincy Phillips on drums) performs on Friday, June 27, 8 pm at &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/jane-mallet-theatre-st-lawrence-centre-arts&quot;&gt;Jane Mallett Theatre&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://boxoffice.stlc.com/public/show.asp?shcode=989&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, go to his &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/roy-hargrove-quintet&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Jon Ballantyne?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-jon-ballantyne</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/jon-ballantyne&quot;&gt;Jon Ballantyne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pianist Jon Ballantyne is a bit hard to pin down - and that&#039;s a good thing.  Equally comfortable playing in small groups or solo; inside the changes or far out; standards or original compositions, Jon always makes each tune, and each solo, his own. A quick look at his performance history demonstrates why he moves smoothly among styles.  He&#039;s shared the stage with more straightahead players like Woody Herman, Barry Harris, Joe Henderson and Joe Lovano, and also with stalwarts of the more improvisation-based side of jazz like Dewey Redman, Dave Liebman, Kenny Wheeler and Cecil Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no small feat to be truly at home across musical styles.  I feel Jon&#039;s playing exudes a confidence which comes only from delving deeply into each style.  In a group setting, his soloing reflects his influences while still being true to the tune being performed - even with a large vocabulary from which to choose, Jon makes beautiful musical choices.  Here&#039;s a sample - an excerpted solo from a quartet performance.  I like the journey the solo takes - I hear some straight-ahead playing, some Thelonious Monk, and flashes of a player who can easily take things outside as required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/X93MGES_r10?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is perhaps in a solo setting though that Jon&#039;s brilliance is most on display. (His solo album &lt;i&gt;Avenue Standard&lt;/i&gt; won a 2007 JUNO Award.) Just as he has mastered various musical styles, he has mastered the art of playing solo.  He knows how to get the most orchestral sounds out of the piano, and which notes to play when, making it easy to forget there is only one musician on stage.  Playing his original solo compositions - or a solo spontaneous improvisation - Jon is also perhaps at his most creative. Without a standard set of chord changes (or even chord changes at all), he&#039;s able to take listeners on a unique journey.  We may not be sure where we&#039;ll end up, but we can be assured of a smooth landing.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;

In a recent Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz - Live! session, I asked Bill King about what separates the pianists who &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; play solo from those that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; soloists.  He had lots to say on the matter (you can hear the full session &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/artistic-directors-guide-jazz-live-bill-king&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but what stuck out in particular was his suggestion that great piano soloists know how to use the whole piano - from the very top to the very bottom - and some of the best examples of great piano soloists were stride players.  The stride style of playing - with the left hand constantly moving from bass note to chordal accompaniment - required an intimate knowledge of when notes in all registers would sound best.  It is perhaps no surprise then that, among the styles in which Jon Ballantyne comfortably performs, is stride piano.  Here&#039;s a sample which starts off stride-ish, then travels in a whole new direction:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What the heck is Mehliana?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/what-heck-mehliana</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/mehliana&quot;&gt;Mehliana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short, factual answer:  Mehliana is the combination of pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Mark Guiliana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short, opinionated answer:  Mehliana is awesomesauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that the combination of two heavyweight artists would produce new, creative and exciting music. Brad Mehldau and Mark Guiliana are each highly acclaimed for their own variety of projects.  Brad is most frequently seen with his trio, but he&#039;s also played regularly with Joshua Redman, Pat Metheny and others. Mark Guiliana was the drummer with bassist Avishai Cohen for eight years, and has played with artists ranging from Meshell Ndegeocello to Matisyahu to Bobby McFerrin. Mehliana puts on display some of the musical and technical approaches for which each musician is recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A duo of piano and drums is rare, but when these two creative musicians get together any challenges which might arise from the unique instrumentation disappear. Rather than trying to force their instruments into one style or another, I feel they are capitalizing on what each instrument does best.  More often than not, that means great grooves from Mark, and great melodic soloing from Brad.  Here&#039;s a taste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/tn6gjoMUEY4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A couple of other points come to mind when I hear Mehliana play.  First, Brad and Mark are well-equipped to tackle complex rhythmic and harmonic playing.  If you want a polyrhythmic, super-imposed tuplet of one sort or another or a slash chord with all of the extensions, they could easily give you that.  But Mehliana is not the outlet for that kind of playing.  Instead, they seem to be concentrating on making music more reminiscent  of dance music.  Longer, groove based jams.  They still throw in a fancy lick here and there, but audiences of all kinds should be able to listen and bop along.  Of course, it takes two master musicians to sustain interest in tunes which tend to be longer than standard radio play - but there are no worries on that front with these two. Through multiple listenings of the album I continue to be intrigued. And, as we&#039;ll see with the track below, you never know where a longer tune might take you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/cnH27mxW0KM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Mehliana&#039;s recently-released CD, &lt;i&gt;Taming the Dragon&lt;/i&gt;, features twelve compositions - six by the duo, and six by Brad Mehldau.  And in this case, composition means many things:  melody and harmony, as usual; but as we&#039;ve seen in the video samples above, they have also thought about how to expand the sonic landscape available to them.  By incorporating synthesizers, pedals, effects, drum machines and other electronics, they have a huge palette from which to choose.  And they use it to great effect.  One more example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Mrokp2Pmapg?list=RDtn6gjoMUEY4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With Mehliana we&#039;re sure to get a mix of composed music and improvisation; a great mix of styles, from street beat to drum and bass to funk and jazz-rock; and a driving, synth-laden, melodic musical treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehliana performs on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square on Saturday, June 28 at 8 pm, on a double-bill with the Stanley Clarke Trio.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C90040ED514&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/mehliana-stanley-clarke-trio&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Bobby McFerrin</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-bobby-mcferrin</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/bobby-mcferrin-spirityouall&quot;&gt;Bobby McFerrin - spirityouall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I&#039;m supposed to go &quot;beyond the bio&quot; with these posts, but here&#039;s a line from Bobby McFerrin&#039;s bio which I think captures what makes him so special as an artist:  &quot;The 10-time Grammy winner has blurred the distinction between pop music and fine art, goofing around barefoot in the world’s finest concert halls, exploring uncharted vocal territory, inspiring a whole new generation of a cappella singers and the beatbox movement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with a musical master, a concert by Bobby McFerrin is so much more that just a concert - it&#039;s an experience. The instrument on display is certainly impressive - whether alone on stage or accompanied by a full orchestra, what he&#039;s able to do with his unique, multi-octave voice, beatboxing and body percussion is unmatched and enthralling. But for me, it&#039;s the rest of the package - the joy which emanates from the stage when he sings; the way in which he engages the audience - both through his stage persona and literally via audience participation - which makes Bobby McFerrin a must-see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than have me try to explain Bobby&#039;s approach to singing, check out this clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/81uJZIF9TCs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The clip above demonstrates Bobby&#039;s immense talent as a performer, but also  his commitment to sharing the joy of singing, and his passion for education.  It&#039;s apt that the video was taken on a day called Sing! Day of Song, in front of 60,000 other singers.  In his own words:  &quot;I try to sing the way I sing in my kitchen, because I just can’t help myself. I want audiences to leave the theatre and sing in their own kitchens the next morning. I want to bring audiences into the incredible feeling of joy and freedom I get when I sing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite videos of Bobby McFerrin I saw thanks to Facebook - someone posted it on their page.  It&#039;s not often that I include a video from the World Science Festival in the Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz…but I think you&#039;ll see why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ne6tB2KiZuk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a previous life, I managed a children&#039;s choir, and the Artistic Director always used to say &quot;If you can talk, you can sing.&quot; I feel Bobby McFerrin is always trying to remind us of the same idea.  We&#039;re not going to be able to do what he does, but we can share in the joy which he gets from singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his 2014 TD Toronto Jazz Festival appearance, he&#039;ll be performing music from his spirityouall project, in which he &quot;re-imagines Americana with beloved spirituals and original songs, raising the roof with joyful grooves.&quot; He&#039;ll have a full band with him on stage, but his voice will be on full display.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/eiEUaYd2MEg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I can&#039;t wait.  Bobby McFerrin - spirityouall performs Friday, June 27, 8 pm on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square.  Local soul extravaganza the Soul Nannies opens up.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C9000ABD377&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/bobby-mcferrin-spirityouall&quot;&gt;visit the concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He studied classical violin from age 5 until 20, however it was picking up the saxophone in high school that led him to exploring other musics, especially jazz, funk, and r&amp;amp;b.  It was Marsh&#039;s father who suggested he apply his newfound love of improvisation on the saxophone to the violin and one day Hugh returned home from school to discover a Balilla amp and a DeArmond pickup for his violin in the living room. A wah wah pedal soon followed and Marsh&#039;s interest in sound processing was born.  In 1977 Marsh and longtime friend drummer Kevan Mckenzie made the move from Ottawa to Toronto. During this first sojourn Hugh had the opportunity to play with many of the Canadian jazz musicians whose work he had long admired including Moe Koffman, Don Thompson, Doug Riley, Claude Ranger and Sonny Greenwich.  While visiting his parents at Christmas 1979 Marsh performed at a benefit for the Children&#039;s Hospital in Ottawa with guitarist Roddy Elias and was introduced to singer songwriter Bruce Cockburn who was performing at the same event. This fortuitous meeting resulted in numerous recordings and world tours with Bruce over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides touring with Cockburn, Hugh became in demand as a gun for hire performing on numerous recordings and touring with Canadian songstress Mary Margaret O&#039;Hara among others. In 1990 while overdubbing violin on Loreena Mckennitt&#039;s breakthrough album &quot;The Visit&quot; he was invited to join her band leading once again to numerous world tours and recordings over the next eight years. After performing in Los Angeles at the Universal Amphitheater in 1998 with Loreena, Hugh received a phone call from Touchstone Pictures about performing on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Armageddon&quot;.  The soundtrack was a steppingstone to Marsh&#039;s ongoing working relationship with Gregson Williams which has included the scores to &quot;Whatever Happened to Harold Smith&quot;, &quot;Spygame&quot;, &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot;, &quot;Sinbad&quot;, &quot;The Rundown&quot;, &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, &quot;Return to Sender&quot;, &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;Seraphim Falls&quot;, &quot;Deja Vu&quot; and &quot;The Number 23&quot;. Hugh is also the featured violin soloist on Hans Zimmer&#039;s score to &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugh Marsh toured with Goth icon Peter Murphy in 2000 and 2002, has been an ongoing member of Turkish Dj Mercan Dede&#039;s Secret Tribe project, one quarter of &quot;Nick Buzz&quot;, and most recently joined clarinet visionary Don Byron&#039;s new quartet &quot;Swiftboat&quot;which includes Kermit Driscoll and Pheeroan Aklaff. Hugh is about to release his third solo recording entitled &quot;Hug Mars&quot;, which features poet Ursula Rucker, James Blood Ulmer, Tanya Tagaq Gillis, Kokayi, Gregoire Maret, Andy Milne, Dafnis Prieto, Pancho Quinto and Pedro Martinez among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsh is a four time recipient of the Jazz Report award for violinist of the year and a two time winner of the National Jazz award for violinist of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
