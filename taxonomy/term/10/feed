 <title>What&#039;s so good about The Bad Plus?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-bad-plus</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/bad-plus&quot;&gt;Bad Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been lucky enough to see The Bad Plus perform live a couple of times, and I have this to say:  when a band is truly operating as a unit, it&#039;s as if the music is being made by some magical force.  The musicians don&#039;t seem to be communicating; there are no obvious visual or aural cues being passed back and forth.  Everything just kind of...happens.  The Bad Plus is such a unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard The Bad Plus on the radio.  It&#039;s possible that is was their version of the Tears for Fears classic &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World.&quot;  I was immediately intrigued by two things:  first, here was a jazz trio doing a cover of a tune I grew up with.  Second, I felt like there was something slightly off kilter about it - in a playful, musical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this double-whammy - familiar tunes and a unique performance style - is what first brought The Bad Plus to the attention of jazz fans around the world.  But they&#039;re so much more than pop covers.  They&#039;ve been playing together for more than ten years, so when pianist Ethan Iverson decides to depart from the melody, or drummer Dave King decides to depart from the time signature, or bassist Reid Anderson decides to depart from the harmony, the other musicians easily take it in stride, sometimes playing along, and sometimes playing it straight...and always creating sparks on the bandstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But - as someone once said - &quot;Talking about music is like dancing about architecture.&quot;  Here&#039;s a track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/20623505&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The tune may not be familiar - in fact, their most recent album is their first exclusively featuring the band&#039;s original compositions - but the groove certainly is.  In some ways, when I listen to a track like this, it doesn&#039;t necessarily matter if I always recognize the tune, or understand exactly what the individual musicians are doing.  The music gets my head bopping, keeps me on my toes, and always surprises me.  It means that their shows are always a bit unpredictable, and always fun.  In case more proof is required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/OruzDa0He-g?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here the trio combines unison passages (Ethan&#039;s left hand playing the bass line with Reid, for example) with total freedom (Dave&#039;s powerhouse drumming) and to me, the end-result is some of the most exciting music being made in jazz today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad Plus performs on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot;&gt;mainstage at Nathan Phillips Square&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, June 24.  Joining the trio is the outstanding tenor saxophonist &lt;a href=&quot;/artist/joshua-redman&quot;&gt;Joshua Redman&lt;/a&gt; (speaking of exciting!); &lt;a href=&quot;/artist/hiromi-trio-project&quot;&gt;Hiromi&#039;s Trio Project&lt;/a&gt; kicks off the double bill at 8 pm.  For complete details, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/hiromi-trio-project-bad-plus-special-guest-joshua-redman&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here&#039;s a behind-the-scenes video on the making of the 2010 release &lt;i&gt;Never Stop&lt;/i&gt;.  It might give you a better sense of the personalities of the musicians and their creative process as a band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. - Ethan Iverson, in addition to being an outstanding pianist, is an interesting and acclaimed blogger.  Check out his blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://dothemath.typepad.com/dtm/contents.html&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Do The Math&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mose Allison Trio</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/mose-allison-trio</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moseallison.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.moseallison.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Mose_Allison.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legendary pianist Mose Allison embodies musical versatility, given his equally brilliant career in jazz, blues, and as a songwriter.  While his boogie woogie and bebop-laden piano style is innovative and fresh sounding, it is as a songwriter that Allison really shines. With songs that have been recorded by The Who, Leon Russell, and Bonnie Raitt and with admirers such as Tom Waits, John Mayall, the Rolling Stones and Van Morrison, Allison remains one of the finest songwriters in the 20th century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mose John Allison Jr. was born in 1927 in Tippo, Mississippi, a cotton town in the Mississippi delta. By the time Mose was in grade school he was already composing boogie woogie tunes on the piano. His father, a piano stride player himself, encouraged the young Mose in his playing but also taught him the meaning of &quot;work on the farm.&quot; Mose plowed cotton with a mule and said once that he is probably one of the few remaining living bluesman who can honestly make that claim. He grew up where &quot;The blues was in the air.&quot; While still in his teens Mose was sitting in with R and B bands on Memphis’s famed musical mecca Beale Street. One of those bands was led by another teenage bluesman, Beale Street Boy, better known as B. B. King. It was a full decade before SUN Records discovery of Elvis Presley. In the 1940’s in the deep south it was not yet socially acceptable for races to mix in public places. When it comes to music Mose says, &quot;I just followed my ears.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1956 Mose migrated to New York where the jazz scene was taking off. He staked out an artistic and musical niche that was both respected and unique. Today, many in the industry view Mose as a musician’s musician, a singer’s singer and a songwriter’s songwriter. Mose is still playing over 150 dates a year and considers his 40 years on the road performing as &quot;on the job training.&quot; In the states Mose has a loyal following but, it was in England during the 1960’s where Mose got the attention of many soon to be British Invaders. The Yardbirds, The Who, John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers and others would soon be covering his songs. Someone said to Mose once, &quot;You were a social critic before Dylan; you were satirical long before Newman; you were rude long before Jagger; why aren’t you a big star?&quot; Mose’s answer to that was, &quot;Just Lucky, I guess.&quot; Mose’s popularity in the states has been on a slow and steady rise. As the man himself wrote, &quot;If you live, your time will come&quot;. Perhaps Mose’s time has finally come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a twenty month period covering 1994-5, a biography on Mose entitled, One Man’s Blues, has been published in the UK, a studio CD on Blue Note was released entitled, The Earth Wants You, a live set from the seventies was released on indie CD entitled, Pure Mose, Rhino Records released a two CD anthology entitled, Allison Wonderland and finally a three CD boxed set from Sony, High Jinks! Trilogy. Certainly it is wonderful time to be a Mose fan.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>John Sherwood Trio</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/john-sherwood-trio</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/sherwood.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Oakville Ontario in 1961, raised in St. Catharines, John Sherwood started his formal training at the age of five.  At age three his father discovered he had an unusually keen ear for music and began a short series of tests to confirm he had been born with perfect pitch.  This would for the most part prove to be a great asset later on as John listened to what other pianists were doing in jazz following his classical studies.&lt;br /&gt;
His formal (classical) piano training came entirely in the form of private instruction by several teachers throughout the fifteen years and by the time John reached high school he was studying at an A.R.C.T. (Associates of the Royal Conservatory of Toronto) level.  As many of his classmates listened to popular music on the radio, John was being exposed to a variety of music at home.  His brothers and sisters were all playing the piano as well as other instruments and his father, accepting John&#039;s fading interest in classical music, presented him with the challenge of playing jazz on the piano.  This indeed was the only form of music that would truly challenge John to maintain the level of technique he had developed. His father was also aware of the benefits of maintaining the practice routine to help John&#039;s discipline in other areas.  He also could see the confidence level enhanced as this new music began to come out.  John was playing more easily in front of people.&lt;br /&gt;
Although John&#039;s dad started the ball rolling, bringing home albums by Tete Montoliu and Clare Fischer, it was his older brother who gave him the first Oscar Peterson recording in 1978.  (&quot;The Paris Concert&quot;   Pablo Live,  Salle Pleyel, 1978)  This would mark a whole new obsession for the music.  John began transcribing what would be many pages of Peterson&#039;s work from this and other albums. Few people have attempted this as it presents technical hurdles that few can overcome, not to mention the many hours of work listening, writing and analyzing.  &quot;The Paris Concert&quot; is an excellent cross section sampler of the many trademarks we associate with Oscar Peterson such as stride, boogie woogie and delicately voiced ballads.&lt;br /&gt;
Today John Sherwood has his own sound. You will not hear as many of the O.P. lines and runs when he sits down to play, but the influence is unmistakable. John was able to look beyond the blinding technique and blistering tempos and realize what makes any piano player great: Touch. The way the note is articulated is what makes it special. &quot;I&#039;ve merely scratched the surface on a few areas of Peterson&#039;s work, but those few areas dominate my way of thinking about the piano. Always. Even when I&#039;m not playing in that style. The classical background is essential in developing touch, tone and technique. In jazz, it’s the rhythm. Once you have that rhythmic concept, the rest falls into place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Few jazz groups in recent memory have amassed such acclaim, and few have inspired such controversy. Their belief in the band ethos and their personal brand of avant-garde populism have put them at the forefront of a new instrumental music movement, drawing audiences both traditional and mainstream. While the bulk of their output has been original music, they have deconstructed songs in the pop, rock as well as the country and classical music idioms.&lt;/p&gt;

The trio consists of Michael Cabe on piano from Seattle, Washington, Mark Lau on bass from Sydney, Australia and Ernesto Cervini on drums from Toronto, Canada.  Their debut album, entitled “Pennsylvania Grey” is made up of original compositions from all three musicians as well as one traditional hymn. The group’s sound is influenced by the trio sounds of the great Oscar Peterson, Peter Erskine and EST.  These three musicians have already had successful careers in their own right, performing at jazz festivals such as the Umbria Jazz Festival in Italy, the Pori Jazz Festival in Finland and others in Canada, the United States, Australia, and Hong Kong.  They have also performed in many of the great jazz venues in the world as well as many of the best in New York City, such as Birdland, Dizzy’s Club, Jazz at Lincoln Center, The 55 Bar and The Jazz Standard and have completed a cross-Canada tour in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Cabe&lt;/b&gt;, 31, is an active pianist/educator in New York City.  Recent recordings include MEM3’s 2008 debut album “Pennsylvania Grey”, Amy Cervini Quartet (ACQ) release of “Famous Blue” in 2007 and “Lovefool” in 2009, and the Kelley Suttenfield release “Where is Love” in 2010.  Cabe has performed at Birdland, the Jazz Standard, Sweet Rhythm, and the Kennedy Center, among other world-class performance venues.  In addition to performance, Cabe maintains an active private piano studio and is the creator and leader of a successful jazz education series through Manhattan School of Music’s Outreach Department, utilizing cutting-edge videoconference technology to deliver performances and lectures to both nationwide and international audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark Lau&lt;/b&gt; is a bassist/composer originally from Sydney Australia now living in downtown Manhattan, New York. Mark has performed at New York City venues such as Birdland, Dizzy&#039;s Club, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, The 55 Bar and Sweet Rhythm in New York City and has played at major festivals around the world including the Umbria Jazz Festival in Italy, the Pori Jazz Festival in Finland, the Rome Film Festival, the Wangarratta, Manly, Brisbane, Melbourne and Bellingen&lt;br /&gt;
Jazz Festivals in Australia, the Hong Kong Fringe Festival and Newport and Cape Cod Festivals in the US and has played on numerous recordings and albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drummer &lt;b&gt;Ernesto Cervini&lt;/b&gt; has quickly become in demand as a sideman and also as a bandleader in North America because of his unique and deep musicality. Ernesto released his debut CD as a leader, Here, in 2006 to critical acclaim: &quot;Here is a wonderful debut that showcases Cervini&#039;s monster chops and compositional abilities.&quot; Budd Kopman, All About Jazz. In 2009 his sophomore release, Little Black Bird featuring Joel Frahm on Saxophones was released on Orange Grove Records, and is being distribute by ANZIC Records (both based in New York City.) &quot;Drummer Ernesto Cervini plays with such conviction and fire that it&#039;s easy to give him your ears and time&quot; says Glen Hall from Exclaim Magazine.  The album received 4 stars from Downbeat Magazine.  Ernesto received his Bachelors degree from the University of Toronto, and a Masters degree from the Manhattan School of Music. Ernesto is continuing to push musical boundaries with his innovative compositions, as well as his imaginative and explosive drumming. He will be a constant in the global jazz scene for decades to come, through his love for musical performance and education.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Laila Biali?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-laila-biali</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/laila-biali&quot;&gt;Laila Biali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve had the good fortune to meet, book and perform with a wide variety of musicians and it&#039;s always a treat to work with someone who is talented as a musician but also a wonderful person.  Laila Biali is one of those people:  an outstanding talent and possibly one of the most modest, down-to-earth people you could meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laila&#039;s accomplishments speak for themselves:  SOCAN Composer of the Year and Keyboardist of the Year at the 2005 National Jazz Awards; performances at New York City’s Carnegie Hall, the acclaimed North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands, the International Jazz Festival in Lima, Peru and the Cotton Club in Tokyo, Japan; and work with other outstanding artists including Chris Botti, Paula Cole, Suzanne Vega and even Sting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it exactly that has led Laila to these successes?  Frankly, she&#039;s really good at what she does.  I met her when she was a piano student at Humber College in Toronto, where she quickly earned a reputation for being a talent to watch for both her piano playing and her composing.  A few years later, when I was working at The Royal Conservatory, she performed as part of a series of jazz concerts.  I couldn&#039;t quite figure out why she had a microphone so close to the piano...but when she started singing, I knew we were in the best kind of trouble:  she has a fantastic voice to compliment her pianistic abilities.  Here&#039;s Laila getting into the spiritual &quot;Down to the River and Pray&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/GobZNOAQwBk?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/GobZNOAQwBk?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What especially appeals to me about Laila&#039;s playing is her choice of repertoire.  On her website she lists a variety of influences; what I hear most though are her classical and jazz training, her incorporation of pop music, and her use of spirituals and gospel music.  As a result, she is a musician who is comfortable in almost any style, and with any size of ensemble.  It&#039;s a pleasure to hear a singer getting away from the usual standards.  Check out this version of Jane Siberry&#039;s &quot;Calling All Angels&quot; - she&#039;s taken the original, added a bit of a jazz feel (and one beat per bar) and turned it into a gorgeous interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;

I thought I&#039;d wrap up this post with a great version of Joni Mitchell&#039;s &quot;Woodstock&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Oliver Jones?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-oliver-jones</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/oliver-jones-trio&quot;&gt;Oliver Jones Trio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shouldn&#039;t be a surprise that Oliver Jones - who grew up only a few blocks away from Oscar Peterson, used to hang out on the Peterson stoop listening to Oscar practice, and took lessons from Oscar&#039;s sister Daisy - swings so hard.  But Oliver Jones is more than just an Oscar Peterson contemporary - over a career spanning more than six decades Oliver has developed a well-deserved reputation as one of Canada&#039;s jazz treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first saw Oliver Jones live about five years ago.  I had heard him on the radio and enjoyed his playing - technical wizardry, great feel, and SWING! - but to see him live was a treat.  He approached each tune with fire and passion, moving around the piano with great ease and outstanding musicality.  I&#039;ve mentioned this concept of &quot;swing&quot; in past entries.  It&#039;s very hard to describe - to me it&#039;s one of the things that makes a jazz performance just FEEL good.  Maybe this will help - Oliver Jones performing &quot;Up Jumped Spring&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/6VXqAQ4j8V4?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/6VXqAQ4j8V4?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As one of my teachers would say at U of T:  not bad if you like that &quot;really amazing jazz stuff&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, one of the things that separates the &quot;pretty good&quot; from the &quot;total pros&quot; is a musician&#039;s ability to play well in a variety of settings - bands of various sizes, all sorts of musical genres, solo or accompanied, etc. - and Oliver Jones is clearly comfortable in no matter what setting.  We see this by taking a quick look at his career path - as a young musician he played everything from swing to rock-n-roll, then spent sixteen years as pianist and musical director for Jamaican singer Kenny Hamilton - but as usual it&#039;s in performance that his true mastery appears.  Check out his performance of the ballad &quot;Remembering Chris&quot; - here Oliver is playing solo, and while he hasn&#039;t lost the fiery touch on the keys, he has adapted his approach to play in a gentler style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/qbM9hh7rNII?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/qbM9hh7rNII?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You could call Oliver Jones the hardest working retired man in show business.  He officially retired in 2000...but since then has recorded no less than four albums on the Justin Time record label, inviting a slew of guest artists into the studio with him including Ranee Lee, Brandi Disterheft, Dave Young, Jim Doxas and Hank Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for one more taste of Oliver&#039;s swinging, gospelly goodness, here he is playing a solo rendition of &quot;Tippin&#039; Home from Sunday School&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
