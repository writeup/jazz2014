 <title>What&#039;s so good about Trombone Shorty?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-trombone-shorty</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/trombone-shorty&quot;&gt;Trombone Shorty &amp;amp; Orleans Avenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I have to admit something.  If I&#039;m going to write about Trombone Shorty, it inevitably will be tinged somewhat with envy.  Or jealousy.  Or whichever of the deadly sins involves my wishing that I had even a portion of the talent, on ONE instrument, that this guy has on TWO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trombone Shorty plays the trombone very well.  He also plays the trumpet very well.  And sings very well.  And puts on a great show.  And he does it all with a ton of energy, performing repertoire which is heavily influenced by the jazz and brass band traditions of New Orleans - his hometown - while incorporating elements of a wide variety of other styles including funk, soul, R&amp;amp;B, hip-hop and rock.  Here&#039;s a taste - the groove starts right away; he solos on trombone at 2:10:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/CisPSigqfls?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Apart from his technical virtuosity, there are a two main aspects of Trombone Shorty&#039;s playing which excite me.  The first is his stage presence.  In the classic style versus substance debate, his playing more than covers the substance portion; but he&#039;s a lot about style too.  When he performs, he puts on a show.  From entry to exit, he and his band-mates give their all, engaging the audience with music, banter, sing-alongs and consistently danceable grooves.  With Trombone Shorty, the music is the show, and the show is the music - there is no separation here of the spectacle from the spectacular.  Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/OqI-Th4xWo8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The other exciting part of Trombone Shorty&#039;s playing for me is his repertoire.  His shows are full of references to the street beats and brass bands of New Orleans, but they&#039;re also a great reflection of the wide diversity of musical styles his fellow musicians - and his audiences - have listened to growing up.  These musicians are not pretending to play in other styles; these other styles are integral to who they are as musicians.  When asked to talk about the music they perform, Trombone Shorty said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We never sat down and really thought about concepts and what we wanted our music to sound like.  It’s just that, over the years, we allowed each one of the band members to bring their influences and taste in music into our music. Anything we hear or are influenced by, it naturally comes out in what we’re trying to do. It’s just our sound, and it happened naturally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for all the flash and dash of the live show, I have great respect for the way Trombone Shorty talks about the music he plays, the city from which he comes, and the importance of passing on musical knowledge and experience to a younger generation.  Here&#039;s a great interview he did for &lt;i&gt;The Times-Picayune&lt;/i&gt; in New Orleans:&lt;/p&gt;

Both New Orleans natives, the pair was steeped in the fundamentals of New Orleans jazz, but inevitably, contemporary styles of music began to seep into their psyches. While LeBlanc attended the famed St. Augustine High School, Moss went to Lil&#039; Wayne&#039;s alma mater McMain High School, and paraded alongside soon-to-be Cash Money Records CEO Ronald &quot;Slim&quot; Williams in the school&#039;s marching band. New sounds were all around and they found them as exciting as the horn-combo style featured in jazz funerals since the turn of the Twentieth Century. In January of 2012, the band released its first international album, Unlock Your Mind, on Rounder Records. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Trombone Shorty &amp; Orleans Avenue</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/trombone-shorty</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tromboneshorty.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.tromboneshorty.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/trombone-shorty2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his third outing for Verve Records, Troy “Trombone Shorty” Andrews further pushes the stylistic envelope with his genre-obliterating sound, a potent mélange of jazz, rock ’n’ roll, soul and other idioms Andrews absorbed as he honed his chops in the melting pot of New Orleans. Like its two predecessors, 2010’s Grammy-nominated Backatown and 2011’s For True, the new Say That to Say This, co-produced by Andrews and kindred spirit Raphael Saadiq, sounds like nothing else out there, as Andrews and his longtime band, Orleans Avenue—guitarist Pete Murano, Bassist Mike Ballard and drummer Joey Peebles—continue their natural musical evolution. In a very real sense, the torch is passed from one great New Orleans band to another on the new album, which features the first new studio recording from the original members of the legendary Meters in 36 years, as they revisit their 1977 classic “Be My Lady,” with Andrews singing lead and playing horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bandleader and multi-instrumentalist describes Say That to Say This as “really funky, like James Brown mixed with the Meters and Neville Brothers, with what I do on top, And we have a bit of R&amp;amp;B from Raphael’s side. All the guys in my band are big, big fans of his, so this is a real dream come true for us. And he’s a fan of New Orleans brass band music, which I didn’t know beforehand. Just listening to his music and the direction he’s going in now, I thought that he would be perfect to work with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title, Andrews explains, is a common New Orleans expression that essentially means “To make a long story short,” serving as a wonderfully on-point description of the album and of Trombone Shorty’s music in general. “This record is a direct expression of everything we hear, everything we’ve seen and everything we’ve been through musically,” Andrews assets. “We’re just making a long story short.”&lt;br /&gt;
Since the release of the For True, which spent 12 weeks atop Billboard’s Contemporary Jazz Chart, Andrews has recorded with an eclectic assortment of artist ranging from Zac Brown to Rod Stewart to Cee Lo Green, while taking the time to initiate a mentoring program at Tulane University via his Trombone Shorty Foundation. He’s appeared on the covers of Downbeat and Jazziz magazines, performed on Conan, The Tonight Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live and Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, and the band was chosen to play the closing set at this year’s New Orleans Jazz &amp;amp; Heritage Festival, a huge honor in the world of true music lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for Andrews, the biggest thrill of all was performing at The White House in February. “That was a dream come true about 50 times over,” he says. “When we started playing, I forgot I was at the White House because I was on stage with all this musical royalty—B.B. King, Mick Jagger, Booker T. Jones, Jeff Beck, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, Gary Clark Jr., the list goes on. And then, when I turned to the audience, there’s the President and the First Lady. I’m like, ‘This can’t be happening.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good things continue to happen for Trombone Shorty, thanks to his virtuosity, charisma and relentless drive to bridge music’s past and future. That he pursues his passion with such humility and unpretentiousness makes his still-unfolding story as compelling as the music he’s making along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

(in 1966) his honours degree in the Humanities, with special emphasis on History and English. It was during his time at Malvern Collegiate that he was taught trombone (and inspired by) the legendary teacher-trombonist George M. McRae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   By 1968 he was touring with the Woody Herman Orchestra as lead trombone and featured soloist and later, with the Count Basie Orchestra, he filled a similar role. While touring with these famed jazz orchestras, he found time to become an original member of Canada&#039;s famed Rock Orchestra, &quot;Lighthouse&quot;, a band with which he continues to perform. For fans of classic rock, &quot;Lighthouse&quot; hits include such monsters as &quot;Sunny Days&quot;, &quot;One Fine Morning&quot;, and &quot;Hats Off To the Stranger&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Through the early &#039;70&#039;s, Russ Little performed in the world famous &quot;Boss Brass&quot;, while pursuing a very successful career as conductor/composer/arranger for the CBC, CTV and Global television networks in Canada. He was also constantly busy writing and conducting for NBC, ABC, General Motors, NFL Football and the famed SCTV comedy series in which he worked closely for many years with John Candy, Eugene Levy and Martin Short.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Heavyweights Brass Band</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/heavyweights-brass-band</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heavyweightsbrassband.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.heavyweightsbrassband.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/HWrecording_0561.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether receiving props from The Roots on Twitter, jamming with puppets on CBC Kids&#039; &lt;i&gt;Mamma Yamma&lt;/i&gt;, recording with the legendary Giovanni Hidalgo or being championed by influential DJ and tastemaker Gilles Peterson, The Heavyweights Brass Band pack a one-two punch of crossover appeal and respect from music&#039;s elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the New Orleans brass band tradition, the Heavyweights&#039; original stance keeps one foot firmly rooted in the rich legacy of jazz, while one foot steps forward into the future. Like the music&#039;s originators, the Heavyweights are unafraid to incorporate influences from disparate areas of the musical spectrum, from pop hits of the day to original compositions, from R&amp;amp;B and funk throwbacks to the infectious rhythms of Latin America, all woven together with the thread of adventuresome sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uppercut ascent of the Heavyweights&#039; arc has been the result of relentless dedication. Touring across Canada and sharing the stage with such influential groups as The Roots, Trombone Shorty, Galactic and Hypnotic Brass Ensemble has helped build the group a loyal following. Now with their sophomore release &lt;i&gt;Brasstronomical&lt;/i&gt;, the Heavyweights are offering a unique sound with emphasis on their original compositions. They delve deeper and more eclectically into each musical direction implied on their first album. &lt;i&gt;Brasstronomical&lt;/i&gt; reveals the band&#039;s music is stronger, bolder, funkier and more mature than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future is bright for the group, with plans in the works for 2014 to be a year of new thresholds as the group blossoms into even more of a hard-hitting powerhouse of sound.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Heavyweights Brass Band is Rob Teehan (Sousaphone), Paul Metcalfe (Sax), Jon Challoner and John Pittman (Trumpet), Chris Butcher (Trombone) and Lowell Whitty (Drums).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ray Anderson</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/ray-anderson</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Prof_Ray_copy_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mark of a great artist has always been to go beyond technical excellence and&lt;br /&gt;
impart a personal vision - a sense of style and self-expression that is indelibly his own.&lt;br /&gt;
Among modern jazz musicians, no one rises to that standard more than trombonist Ray&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson, whose sublime mastery of the tricks of his trade is equalled by the bountiful&lt;br /&gt;
spirit he pours into his one-of-a kind sound.&lt;br /&gt;
The man who wrote If I Ever Had a Home It Was a Slide Trombone, one of his&lt;br /&gt;
many original compositions, has inhabited every nook and cranny of his horn.&lt;br /&gt;
Described by critic Gary Giddins as “one of the most compellingly original trombonists,”&lt;br /&gt;
he is by turns a supremely lyrical player and bold texturalist, a warmly natural-sounding&lt;br /&gt;
soloist and footloose innovator. Broadening the trombone&#039;s sonic scope with his extended&lt;br /&gt;
techniques, brilliantly unconventional use of the plunger mute and demonstrative vocallike&lt;br /&gt;
tones, he played a major role in reawakening interest in the instrument in the &#039;80s.&lt;br /&gt;
Named five straight years as best trombonist in the Down Beat Critics Poll and declared&lt;br /&gt;
“the most exciting slide brass player of his generation” by the Penguin Guide to Jazz on&lt;br /&gt;
CD, Anderson has shown remarkable range. He has led or co-led a daunting assortment&lt;br /&gt;
of tradition-minded and experimental groups, big bands, blues and funk projects and even&lt;br /&gt;
a trombone quartet. He is recognized as an original and compelling composer and has&lt;br /&gt;
recorded more than 70 of his own compositions with these groups. In the tradition of&lt;br /&gt;
Louis Armstrong, he is a colorful and exuberant performer and a spirited vocalist who&lt;br /&gt;
induces smiles with his unusual split tones and screech effects.&lt;br /&gt;
A native of Chicago&#039;s Hyde Park, where he was born in 1952, Anderson is the son&lt;br /&gt;
of theologians. He took up the trombone in fourth grade, influenced by his father&#039;s&lt;br /&gt;
Dixieland recordings. “The sound of the trombone was appealing to me,” he says. “All&lt;br /&gt;
the people I heard play it sounded like they were having fun.” (The artists he strongly&lt;br /&gt;
responded to, he later learned, included &#039;bone greats Vic Dickenson and Trummy Young.)&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson attended the University of Chicago Lab School, where one of his classmates&lt;br /&gt;
was another notable trombone original, George Lewis. His teachers included Frank Tirro,&lt;br /&gt;
who went on to become dean of Yale&#039;s music school, and Dean Hey, who introduced&lt;br /&gt;
young Ray to musicians as diverse as John Cage and Archie Shepp. As teenagers, he and&lt;br /&gt;
Lewis were exposed to the exploratory sounds of the Association for the Advancement of&lt;br /&gt;
Creative Musicians, with whose illustrious members Anderson later played extensively.&lt;br /&gt;
At the same time, he had his head turned by the popular, groundbreaking sounds of James&lt;br /&gt;
Brown, Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix.&lt;br /&gt;
He played in R&amp;amp;B bands while attending college in Minnesota and Los Angeles&lt;br /&gt;
and funk and Latin bands while living in San Francisco. On the West Coast, he also&lt;br /&gt;
hooked up with three standout members of its progressive jazz community, tenor&lt;br /&gt;
saxophonist David Murray and drummers Charles Moffett and Stanley Crouch (now a&lt;br /&gt;
leading critic, newspaper columnist and author).&lt;br /&gt;
In 1973, Anderson moved to New York. He studied and played with the eminent&lt;br /&gt;
reed player, composer and music theorist Jimmy Giuffre, joined drummer Barry&lt;br /&gt;
Altschul&#039;s trio and played for three years with the quartet of AACM saxophone hero&lt;br /&gt;
Anthony Braxton. In the &#039;80s, he garnered attention with collective bands including the&lt;br /&gt;
funk-oriented Slickaphonics and the trio BassDrumBone, featuring bassist Mark Helias&lt;br /&gt;
and drummer Gerry Hemingway. On a series of acclaimed recordings, he has ranged&lt;br /&gt;
from Ellingtonia and jazz classics (Old Bottles, New Wine, with Kenny Baron, Cecil&lt;br /&gt;
McBee and Dannie Richmond, is an album&#039;s worth of them) to striking originals&lt;br /&gt;
including Muddy &amp;amp; Willie (as in Chicago blues immortals Waters and Dixon) and&lt;br /&gt;
Raven-a-Ning (a play on Thelonious Monk&#039;s Rhythm-a-Ning) named after his son&lt;br /&gt;
Raven).&lt;br /&gt;
The prolific Anderson also has demonstrated his special supportive skills on a&lt;br /&gt;
remarkably wide assortment of albums by Braxton, Murray, Charlie Haden&#039;s&lt;br /&gt;
Liberation Music Orchestra, Dr. John, the George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band,&lt;br /&gt;
Luther Allison, Bennie Wallace, Henry Threadgill, Barbara Dennerlein, John&lt;br /&gt;
Scofield, Roscoe Mitchell, the New York Composers Orchestra, Sam Rivers&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
Rivbea Orchestra and others.&lt;br /&gt;
While pushing his sound into the future, Anderson has frequently returned to his&lt;br /&gt;
early love of New Orleans music for inspiration. Both his party going Alligatory Band&lt;br /&gt;
and second-line-to-the-max Pocket Brass Band, featuring tuba great Bob Stewart, are&lt;br /&gt;
rooted in the Crescent City. “I feel like a spiritual son of that city,” he says. “Some part of&lt;br /&gt;
me lives down there. Dr. John, Professor Longhair, the whole thing grabs me. You get&lt;br /&gt;
caught up in those rhythms, right at the crossroads of jazz and funk, and you can&#039;t quit&lt;br /&gt;
them.”&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson also heads up the blues-dipped Lapis Lazuli Band, featuring&lt;br /&gt;
singer/organist (and old Chicago friend) Amina Claudine Myers, and periodically&lt;br /&gt;
reunites with Lewis, Gary Valente and Craig Harris in the all-star trombone quartet,&lt;br /&gt;
Slideride.&lt;br /&gt;
As revealed by composition titles Disguise the Limit, The Alligatory Abagua,&lt;br /&gt;
The Gahtooze and Snoo Tune (for his daughter Anabel), the trombonist is unabashedly a&lt;br /&gt;
good-time player. But as frolicsome as his act can get, he says, “I most certainly don&#039;t&lt;br /&gt;
play joke music. I&#039;m much too aware of the giant shoulders I&#039;m standing on, all the great&lt;br /&gt;
players who have given so much to music, and thespiritual responsibility of the&lt;br /&gt;
musician.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I do think humor is divine. When human beings laugh or smile, they are in a&lt;br /&gt;
state of grace. I insist on having fun when I play and if the band enjoys itself, the&lt;br /&gt;
audience does, too. But music contains every feeling and emotion; it’s ultimately an&lt;br /&gt;
expression of love. It&#039;s the healing force of the universe, as Albert Ayler said. My music&lt;br /&gt;
is about inclusion. I always want to bring everyone along on the trip. I want to move&lt;br /&gt;
people also. I once described the Pocket Brass Band as having one ear cocked to the&lt;br /&gt;
thump of the second line dancers&#039; feet and the other tuned to the music of the spheres.&lt;br /&gt;
That describes all my music. I want to have it all.”&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson is gifted teacher and has long been in demand for workshops and&lt;br /&gt;
master classes around the world. In 2001, he was a Guest Faculty member of the Music&lt;br /&gt;
Department at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He was hired as the&lt;br /&gt;
Director of Jazz Studies there in 2003. “I really enjoy teaching,” he says. “As I get older I&lt;br /&gt;
seek to serve music not only by performing but by helping to inspire the next generation.&lt;br /&gt;
Another aspect of this aspiration is my increasing interest in composition.” In response to&lt;br /&gt;
this interest he has been awarded grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the&lt;br /&gt;
Fund for U.S. Artists at International Festivals, the Oberon Foundation and Chamber&lt;br /&gt;
Music America. In 2001 he became a John S. Guggenheim Fellow.&lt;/p&gt;
