 <title>Nels Cline and Julian Lage?  Really?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/nels-cline-and-juian-lage-really</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/nels-cline&quot;&gt;Nels Cline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first blush, it may seem like an odd combination - a guitarist perhaps best known for playing in a rock band, but whose experience in jazz, punk and experimental music goes back decades; teaming up with a relative newcomer on the scene with an affinity for a more traditional approach. Having seen them perform together, though, I can assure you - they make beautiful music together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any musical partnership requires that each player have open years, and be able to react to what the other is doing.  Happily, the respective experience of these two particular guitarists lends itself well to an open-eared collaboration.  Nels Cline has made a name for himself performing in settings which require maximum flexibility - in his own Nels Cline Singers, with musicians like Tim Berne, Jim Black, Charlie Haden and Yoko Ono, and even with painter Norton Wisdom for a project called Stained Radiance. Julian Lage, recognized as a child prodigy, was taken under Gary Burton&#039;s wing but over the past several years has explored broad musical horizons for his own albums and in projects with Fred Hersch, Mark O&#039;Connor, John Patitucci, Bela Fleck and others.  The result is a mix of their various influences.  Here&#039;s a relatively straight-ahead sample which shows off some of the technique which has earned each guitarist acclaim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/BP1tFOcQA9c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Chops aside, though, to me the most interesting aspect of the duo is the musical travels their performances take.  I didn&#039;t really know about Nels Cline until recently when a colleague raved about him (I admit to not knowing much about Wilco); Julian Lage could (though less now) be classified as an emerging artist.  So when I saw the duo perform at Winter Jazzfest in New York in 2012, I wasn&#039;t exactly sure what to expect, other than &quot;this should probably be good.&quot;  It ended up being a highlight of the weekend for me.  When Lage and Cline perform together, they mix composition with spontaneous improvisation; groove-based playing with more ethereal textures; blues licks with what could be classical excerpts.  The result is unexpected, fascinating, and a joyful ride.  Here&#039;s another clip - this one travels a bit further afield than the first example above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/o9bt2AnT0eU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A concert featuring fully improvised music requires a different investment from an audience - there must be a willingness to suspend pre-conceived notions of melody and harmony, and to just go along for the ride. What reassures me, when I&#039;m entering into a less-familiar musical situation as an audience member, is the knowledge that the music will be performed at a high level. Nels Cline has been hailed by &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; as one of the top 100 guitarists of all time, while Julian Lage was recently a winner in the &lt;i&gt;Downbeat Magazine&lt;/i&gt; &quot;Rising Star Guitar&quot; category.  So you will be in good musical hands when these two take the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to find online a (somewhat shaky) recording of that Winter Jazzfest show which impressed me so - here&#039;s a clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/-G5XmSRlt64?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Nels Cline/Julian Lage Duo performs at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, June 24 at 10 pm.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91BD47B693&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/nels-cline-julian-lage-duo&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wagner Petrilli</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/wagner-petrilli-sextet</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wagnerpetrilli.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.wagnerpetrilli.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/wagner-petrilli.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wagner Petrilli discovered his passion for the violao (Brazilian guitar) at an early age in the streets of Brazil. He grew up apprenticing under various artists in the music scenes of Sao Paulo and the coastal city of Santos. From 1994 to 1997 he studied violao, harmony and history at the Conservatorio Municipal de Santos. After that Wagner honed his skills under the tutelage of renowned artists Filo Machado and Helio Delmiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998 Wagner moved to Toronto and immersed himself in the city’s Brazilian music scene. He has performed in numerous music venues and celebrations throughout Toronto including the Harbourfront Centre, Via Italia Festival, Taste of the Danforth, and the Brazilian Ball. Wagner has also performed throughout Ontario and Canada, including the Stratford Festival, the Halifax Jazz Festival, the Kingston Jazz Festival and the Elora Festival, and at high profile venues including Massey Hall and Koerner Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003 Wagner began teaching Brazilian guitar (violao) at The Royal Conservatory of Music in the World Music faculty. He has taught both private lessons and workshops to students with widely varying musical abilities. In 2009, he received his Artist-Educator certificate from The Conservatory’s Learning Through the Arts program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 Wagner was the recipient of a Canada Council for the Arts grant for professional musicians to study guitar and violao with Celso Machado in Gibsons, British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Wagner’s band Sambacana received a Canada Council for the Arts grant to record a full- length CD which was entitled Nos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wagner has been composing songs and writing lyrics for the better part of his life in a variety of styles, most of which would be considered World Music, and specifically the music of Brazil. In 2011, he received a Toronto Arts Council grant to compose and arrange 10 songs for a full-length CD of his own compositions. In 2012, he received a Canada Council for the Arts grant for recording this CD. The CD is scheduled to be released in the summer of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Julian Lage</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/julian-lage</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.julianlage.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.julianlage.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hailed by All About Jazz as &quot;a giant in the making,&quot; Lage grew up in California and was the subject of an Academy Award-nominated documentary, Jules at Eight. He gained pivotal early exposure as a protégé of legendary vibraphonist Gary Burton, recording and touring with Burton on two projects: Generations (2004) and Next Generation (2005). Other recent high-profile sideman appearances include Lucky To Be Me and Let It Come To You by longtime friend and close collaborator, pianist Taylor Eigsti. Having reunited with Gary Burton for live engagements beginning in 2010, Julian can also be heard this year as a member of the &quot;New Gary Burton Quartet&quot; on the forthcoming CD Common Ground (featuring Scott Colley and Antonio Sanchez).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his previous Sounding Point, Lage arrived at a unique approach to composition and ensemble craft, a searching yet accessible sound that earned him his 2009 Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. The music was &quot;a major find,&quot; declared Time Out New York - &quot;springy, intelligent chamber Americana that fits perfectly into a spectrum of Nonesuch-style players like Bill Frisell and Chris Thile&#039;s Punch Brothers.&quot; This new album represents another stage in that evolution, building on the proven strengths of and solidifying a unique identity for Lage&#039;s working band but continuing to open new doors and exploring new horizons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether he&#039;s playing his Linda Manzer electric archtop guitar, writing with his rare 1934 R.A. Mango, which he used to compose &quot;233 Butler&quot; (Lage recorded the track on his Manzer), or the 1932 Gibson L-5 heard on the tension-filled &quot;Telegram&quot; (inspired by Garry Harrison&#039;s &quot;Red Prairie Dawn&quot;), Lage brings a purity of tone and consistency of attack to everything in his repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;

Combining breathtaking technique with an informed musical intelligence, the self-taught Cline displays a mastery of guitar expression that encompasses delicate lyricism, sonic abstractions, and skull-crunching flights of fancy, inspiring Jazz Times to call him &quot;The World&#039;s Most Dangerous Guitarist.&quot; His recording and performing career - spanning jazz, rock, punk, and experimental - is well into its fourth decade, with over 130 recordings, including at least 30 for which he is leader. Born in Los Angeles in 1956, Cline has received many accolades including Rolling Stone anointing him as both one of 20 &quot;new guitar gods&quot; and one of the top 100 guitarists of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

He started out as a typical teenage rock &#039;n roll guitar player, playing in basement bands and at high school dances. In his late teens, no longer enamored with playing blues based rock music, a friend turned him on to Miles Davis&#039;s classic disk &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. Hearing this record was, for Lorne, a musical revelation that led to a dramatic change is his approach to playing music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorne was inspired to get together with like-minded friends, playing constantly, developing his chops and basic musical conception. Lorne began a more formal study of music while attending York University, in the mid 70&#039;s (&#039;74/75), focusing on jazz theory and performance. He spent two years under the guidance of John Gittins and Bob Witmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time Lorne was also starting to do a bit of playing around Toronto, which eventually led to a week at the legendary George&#039;s Spaghetti House with saxophonist Jerry Toth. Jerry was one of the finest Canadian saxophone players. His encouragement and support was instrumental in providing Lorne with the opportunity to be heard by the Toronto jazz audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorne started to work frequently at George&#039;s as a leader and sideman, as well as the famous Toronto jazz venue &quot;Bourbon Street&quot; playing with a who&#039;s who of the jazz world including Chet Baker, Pepper Adams, Bob Brookmeyer, Carl Fontana and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one week at George&#039;s Spaghetti House as a sideman with trombonist Butch Watanabe, Lorne met the jazz legend Oscar Peterson.
