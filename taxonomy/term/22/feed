 <title>What the heck is the Coltrane Ballads project?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/what-heck-coltrane-ballads-project</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toronto will be host to a unique show when Daniel Jamieson presents his Coltrane Ballads project this Monday, September 30 at the Al Green Theatre.  I asked Daniel to tell me more about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - Tell me about the Coltrane Ballads project - what does it look like, and how did it come about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - I came up with the idea for the Coltrane Ballads project in the spring of 2012. I had just returned from the Metropole Orchestra&#039;s Arrangers Workshop where I had the chance to work with Vince Mendoza and Kurt Elling. It was one of the best weeks of my life. I came back incredibly inspired and eager to continue writing for Orchestra. So I tried to think of an interesting project that would allow me this creative outlet. That is when I realized John Coltrane&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Ballads&lt;/i&gt; album was going to be in its 50th year. I spent a lot of time listening to the CD and decided to design a 50th anniversary concert. I then contacted Victor Cheng, who has led his own classical orchestra, the Sneak Peek Orchestra, for a few years. I proposed that we combine my big band (the Danjam Orchestra) with his Sneak Peek Orchestra. Victor was thrilled with the idea and we both agreed that saxophonist Mike Ruby would be a fantastic soloist. When the Metropole found out about the project, they asked if I would conduct a performance of the new &lt;i&gt;Ballads&lt;/i&gt; arrangements with Joe Lovano as the soloist. So I spent the better part of last year arranging the 8 iconic tunes from the record for this hybrid orchestra. The Metropole performance took place last May in Amsterdam. The house was packed and the orchestra was at its best! I was very proud of the work we did that week. Working with Joe Lovano and John Riley (drums) was a treat. Some incredible memories!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - Tell me a bit about the Metropole Orkest - what makes them unique?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - The Metropole is the only orchestra of its kind in the world. It is a hybrid ensemble made up of traditional big band instrumentation plus strings, winds, percussion and harp. They are not a classical orchestra. The Metropole specializes in jazz, pop, and film music. This band can swing and groove like no other. There is simply no other orchestra that can compare! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - As you mention above, your experience with the Metropole goes beyond being a fan - you&#039;ve had the opportunity to work with them and their conductor Vince Mendoza.  Tell us about your interactions with the Metropole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - I am fortunate to have been asked to write for them frequently and I have just been booked to conduct them at the Edison Jazz &amp;amp; World Music Awards this November. I look forward to working with them for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - How did you approach the Coltrane Ballads project - what separates it from other tributes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - My goal was to create a fresh take on the music. There are certainly elements from the original CD that creep their way in to the music; I like to think that the spirit of the original CD inspired my arrangements. A particular challenge is that the concert features a lot of ballads in a row! An obvious statement, perhaps, given the material…but it is an important factor to keep in mind when programming a concert. As I said to the audience in Amsterdam:  I think it helps to think of it as 1 piece with 8 movements - the pieces were designed to work together to create an overall musical message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - The project has been performed once before; what will be special about this Monday&#039;s performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - It was amazing performing the music in Amsterdam but it will really mean something to me to perform it here in Toronto - my home - in the presence of friends, family and peers. I have known Mike Ruby since we were kids - he is a good friend and is tremendously talented; John Riley will be joining us from New York to play drums. John is likely best known for his work with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra; I think he&#039;s simply the best in the world. Arlia de Ruiter will be joining us on violin from Amsterdam - she is the concert master of the Metropole and she will be our concert master for the evening; all of our string players are very excited to work with her. And Victor Cheng is graciously letting me take the conductor&#039;s chair while he covers the piano part. It is sure to be a night to remember! We are hoping a combined concert becomes a yearly tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JG - To get a taste of the big band/orchestra hybrid, let&#039;s go back to the Metropole.  If you had to pick one Metropole performance to recommend, which would it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ - Here is one of my favourite recordings of the Metropole - performing Vince Mendoza&#039;s composition &quot;Otono&quot;: &lt;/p&gt;

The Coltrane Ballads project takes place this Monday, September 30, 8 pm at the Al Green Theatre (750 Spadina Avenue, in the Miles Nadal Jewish Community Centre).  Tickets and information are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://danjam.ca/coltrane-ballads-in-toronto/&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;danjam.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Jaron Freeman-Fox and the Opposite of Everything</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/jaron-freeman-fox-and-opposite-everything</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoppositeofeverything.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.theoppositeofeverything.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/JFF%26theOOE-2-web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described as “Gogol Bordello meets The Mothers of Invention”, or “Tom Waits playing the fiddle while fronting The Mahavishnu Orchestra” Jaron Freeman-Fox &amp;amp; The Opposite of Everything somehow combine bluegrass with Indian music, afro-beat with sea shanties, or klezmer with the blues, and make it sound like the most natural thing in the world. With a diverse cast of Toronto’s finest and most adventurous musicians, the band has toured the country coast to coast, and showcased their highly original music at festivals as diverse as The Ottawa Jazz Festival, The Newfoundland Sound Symposium, The Vancouver Folk Festival, and recently at world music expo WOMEX, held this year in Thessaloniki, Greece.  After three years of touring and perfecting their repertoire, the band finally has a new album showcasing the full breadth of their sound, and will be releasing it in February 2013!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fronting the ensemble, Jaron Freeman-Fox dances down the fine line between the beautiful and the ridiculous, while redefining what the violin can do.  Having played on over 40 albums (Jayme Stone, Autorickshaw, Peter Katz) and having toured the world many times over as a side-man with bands such as The David Woodhead Confabulation and Delhi 2 Dublin, Freeman-Fox fuses his roots of Celtic and bluegrass fiddling with his study of Indian classical music and jazz, playing the 5-string violins of his late mentor; fiddle pioneer Oliver Schroer.  In 2010 Jaron released his award-winning instrumental debut album &lt;i&gt;Manic Almanac : Slow Möbius&lt;/i&gt; and formed this fiery band The Opposite of Everything. Since then, Jaron has performed in Brunei, Indonesia, India, throughout the US, UK, Europe and at festivals across Canada, for crowds of over 100,000, royalty, and audiences dressed as wizards. (True story!)&lt;/p&gt;

With an eclectic instrumentation of voice, strings, saxophone, brass, and jazz rhythm section, the Storytellers are constantly reaching for new textures, ranges of emotion, musical surprise and humor to provoke and delight the listener. The music is often programmatic in nature, telling stories and reflections of human experience to communicate and connect people, attempting to create a new genre of &quot;narrative composition&quot;. Shannon’s music has been described as “art for those who want art and entertainment for those who want entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Graham is a saxophonist/violist/vocalist/composer/band leader who has been contributing to the Toronto music scene since moving here in 2008. Her diverse background began with classical viola study, moved into the study of jazz saxophone and improvised music, and most recently pop and salsa music. Originally from Edmonton, Alberta, she earned a diploma in performance from Grant MacEwan University in 2008, was recognized with the Rawlco Radio award and CARAS Fred Sherrat award, and played extensively in orchestras and string quartets. In 2011, Shannon completed her Bachelors of Music in jazz performance at the University of Toronto, where she won the Alumni Music Association award for two consecutive years and participated in the Banff International Workshop for Jazz and Creative Music. Aside from leading The Storytellers, Shannon performs frequently throughout the GTA with Castell Entertainment, studies composition with Roger Bergs, and is co-artistic director of the Spectrum Composers Collective, an organization dedicated to commissioning new music and producing concerts that feature Toronto’s emerging chamber jazz movement.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>John Southworth and Andrew Downing</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/spectrum</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/photo-spectrum-web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Southworth is one of Canada’s most distinctive and iconoclastic music artists, respected for forging ahead with his own unique brand of music-making, while garnering high praise for his inimitable contribution. His most recent record, &lt;i&gt;Human Cry&lt;/i&gt;, was released on Toronto&#039;s Barnyard Records and recorded with The South Seas (Andrew Downing, bass; Justin Haynes, guitar; Jean Martin, drums). &lt;i&gt;Human Cry&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s supremely crafted, elegiac songs offer rare and intimate illuminations, artfully performed with seasoned precision and grace. His songs have been performed by some of Canada’s most prestigious music artists; recently John contributed songs to Buck 65, Hawksley Workman and Jully Black records. He is a regular collaborator with Toronto’s Art of Time Ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto-based double bass player, cellist, composer and bandleader Andrew Downing plays primarily in the creative jazz scene in Canada, but also performs classical chamber music, improvised music, folk and roots music, and world music. He has written pieces for Ensemble Meduse, Toca Loca, Runcible Spoon, The Prince George Symphony and The Urban Arts Brass Ensemble and has written arrangements for Patricia O&#039;Callaghan, The Gryphon Trio and The Art of Time Ensemble. Upcoming projects include a composition for Orchestra London with banjo player Jayme Stone. Andrew leads his own chamber jazz ensemble, has seven albums as a bandleader, and is also a member of the David Occhipinti Quartet and the Lina Allemano Four. He has won Juno, SOCAN, Grand Prix de Jazz (Montreal Jazz Festival), and two West Coast Music Awards.  Andrew is on faculty at the University of Toronto and has taught at Wilfred Laurier University, the Banff Centre&#039;s Jazz Workshop and the Creative Music Workshop in Halifax.&lt;/p&gt;

With the musicians she met in jazz/fusion workshops at the renowned Humber Jazz program, she formed a band around her unique fusion of jazz with the Balkan and South African influences of her childhood. The unique richness of her sound has attracted guest appearances from some of Toronto’s most acclaimed jazz virtuosi, including Bill McBirnie, Dave Restivo, Ted Quinlan, and Jim Vivian. Regulars at The Rex Hotel, The Thing Is also performs at Gallery 345, The Trane Studio, The Fermenting Cellar, Clinton’s, The Music Gallery, and at the Art Gallery of Ontario in December 2011, where they premiered a composition commissioned by the Koffler Centre to interpret a painting by Marc Chagall, entitled &quot;La Danse,&quot; that was on exhibit from the Pompidou Centre in Paris, France. Tova’s 4-octave range, predilection for odd time signatures and hard-grooving arrangements make for a rare treat; music that grabs and holds both the mind and the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adventurous composition and great musicianship combined with a wild array of influences for a cool and unique sound.”- Alan Davis, Small World Music&lt;/p&gt;

A follow up to the group’s two independently released EPs, ‘Of The Waves’ is a collaboration between Hobson’s Choice and producer Jean Martin of Barnyard Records. ‘Of The Waves’ is the newest release from the label known internationally for producing some of Toronto’s finest creative music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobson’s Choice is a Toronto based chamber-jazz quartet comprised of Michael Davidson on vibraphone, Rebecca Hennessy on trumpet, Felicity Williams on voice, and Harley Card,  voice and acoustic guitar. The group’s music falls somewhere between jazz, instrumental chamber music, and singer songwriter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a distinctive instrumentation and a broad notion of song form, Hobson’s Choice is a collaborative project that features compositions by all four members. The four instruments work as equal parts of the band, each providing melody, harmony, rhythm, and texture over the course of a performance. Compositions bridge the gap between lyric based songs growing out of popular music traditions and instrumental pieces that are more indicative of chamber music. The improvisation embedded in jazz informs the music’s creation, from it’s conception through each successive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
