 <title>What&#039;s so good about Peter Appleyard?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-peter-appleyard</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/peter-appleyard&quot;&gt;Peter Appleyard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not too often that I get to use the words &quot;Canadian&quot; &quot;jazz&quot; and &quot;legend&quot; in one sentence.  But when it comes to Peter Appleyard, it&#039;s a most apt description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Appleyard has toured the world, sharing stages with Benny Goodman’s world class band, Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, Oscar Peterson, Tony Bennett and Mel Tormé.  He&#039;s an Officer of the Order of Canada and will be named an Oscar Peterson Lifetime Achievement honoree at this year&#039;s Montreal Jazz Festival (2012).  He&#039;s released over 20 albums under his own name and has performed on countless others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;ve read some of my other posts, you will likely have noticed a recurring theme or two when it comes to what I consider to be important musical qualities.  For example:  fun and swing.  I finally got to see Peter Appleyard live about three years ago and I was floored by his performance.  He epitomized, in a few short tunes (his mini-set was part of a larger show), so much of what I think a master performer should be.  He played the stuffing out of the vibraphone, had a great time doing so, and was completely engaging with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High quality video clips of Peter are hard to find online, but here&#039;s one from 1997 which shows off not only his ability on the instrument, but his incredible sense of swing - check out especially the &quot;head out&quot; (when the melody comes back in after the solos) around 2:30:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ARcO06nAjK4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A couple of things stand out for me in this performance.  First, Peter&#039;s incredibly gracious, allowing his bandmates to do most of the soloing.  His comping (what he plays behind the soloists) is tasteful - he&#039;s sure not to crowd the soloist.  His sense of time and swing are impeccable.  And he looks like he&#039;s having a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I also like about Peter is his desire to foster and encourage emerging artists.  In the 1970&#039;s he had a television show called &lt;i&gt;Peter Appleyard Presents&lt;/i&gt; on which he introduced such artists as Scott Hamilton and Warren Vache.  Peter&#039;s most recent recording features 11 of Canada&#039;s most talented emerging and established female vocalists - here again, Peter&#039;s happy to give his guests centre stage.  Lest you think that, with a career spanning close to 70 years, Peter is slowing down, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truenorthrecords.com/Albums.php?album_id=750&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;sample tracks from the new album&lt;/a&gt; - recorded just this past winter - at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truenorthrecords.com/Albums.php?album_id=750&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;True North Records website&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself:  Peter is still swinging after all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Appleyard is an engaging performer, a master story teller, and a musician not to be missed.  He takes to the stage on Tuesday, June 26, 8 pm at &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/koerner-hall&quot;&gt;Koerner Hall&lt;/a&gt; with nine of the &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot;:  Jill Barber, Emilie-Claire Barlow, Ranee Lee, Elizabeth Shepherd, Jackie Richardson, Diana Panton, Lily Frost, Carol McCartney and host Heather Bambrick.
