 <title>What&#039;s so good about Joey DeFrancesco?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-joey-defrancesco</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/joey-defrancesco&quot;&gt;Joey DeFrancesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m trying to figure out where exactly my love of the Hammond B3 organ sound comes from.  I didn&#039;t grow up listening to blues or gospel; I went to synagogue, not church; and my record collection is more big band and trumpet than keys.  But somewhere along the way, I took out a Jimmy Smith CD from the library and something clicked.  Since then, a well-played gospelly, bluesy organ has resonated somewhere deep within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we&#039;re going to talk about Hammond B3 organ, we must talk about Joey DeFrancesco.  Essentially, Joey DeFrancesco encapsulates in his playing everything that comes to mind when I think about great organ:  he swings like crazy; his vocabulary includes all of the blues and gospel licks which sound so great on the instrument; and his playing exudes the sense of fun for which I feel the instrument may have been created. Let&#039;s launch right in to a track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/dFcVaitADW8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In that one track, he shows off what&#039;s made him one of the best in the world: gospelly goodness off the top, great blues licks, and technical virtuosity.  What you might not have noticed - especially if you haven&#039;t seen many organists play live - is what&#039;s happening underneath the keyboard. While his hands are busy playing the chords and melodies (and soloing), Joey&#039;s feet are busy holding down the bass line.  I don&#039;t know enough about how organists train to suggest that all organists learn this skill; what I do know - having seen a few - is that not all organists use their feet in performance. Just another notch in the &quot;complete package&quot; column for DeFrancesco! Here&#039;s a clip demonstrating his fancy footwork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/XfolH2D-ZzI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Any great musician - and any great combo - knows exactly when to ratchet up the tension or the excitement in a performance.  For me, somehow the sound of the organ heightens that musical tension even more.  Maybe it&#039;s the  way certain chords sound and feel especially crunchy - so when they resolve, the resolution is particularly satisfactory. I&#039;m not sure.  What I do know is that Joey DeFrancesco understands perfectly how to create and release musical tension, and how best to use the instrument to his advantage. Here&#039;s a clip of two organ masters - Joey along with Dr. Lonnie Smith - which demonstrates two different styles of organ playing:&lt;/p&gt;

Joey DeFrancesco takes the stage along with Jeff Parker (guitar) and George Fludas (drums) on June 25, 8 pm at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91BE51B7A7&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit his &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/joey-defrancesco-trio&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Kenny Wayne Shepherd</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/kenny-wayne-shepherd</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kennywayneshepherd.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.kennywayneshepherd.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/KennyWayneShepherd250.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utter the phrase &quot;young blues guitarist&quot; within earshot of anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the modern musical vanguard and the first name they are most likely to respond with will be Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Still barely in his 30s, the Louisiana born axeman and songsmith has been selling millions of albums, throwing singles into the Top 10, shining a light on the rich blues of the past and forging ahead with his own modern twist on a classic sound he has embodied since his teens. He met Stevie Ray Vaughan at 7, shared the stage with New Orleans legend Bryan Lee at13. As an adult, he continues to create genre-defining blues-infused rock n&#039; roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny Wayne Shepherd&#039;s How I Go not only serves as a strong reminder of the chops that caused Guitar World to place him right behind B.B. King and Eric Clapton on their list of blues guitarists, but it&#039;s the strongest indication yet of his gifted songwriting talent. The album pairs Kenny&#039;s deeply soulful and impassioned takes on classic material like Bessie Smith&#039;s &quot;Backwater Blues,&quot; Albert King&#039;s &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; and The Beatles &quot;Yer Blues&quot; alongside the strongest writing and co-writing of his career thus far. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Dr. Lonnie Smith?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-dr-lonnie-smith</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/dr-lonnie-smith&quot;&gt;Dr. Lonnie Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When discussions about musicians take place, there is a tendency to talk about how many notes a musician can play, the speed with which those notes are played, and the force with which they are emitted from the musician&#039;s instrument.  And there is certainly validity to that type of discussion - being at the top of the heap musically requires an advanced technical proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lonnie Smith is no exception when it comes to technical firepower; Jimmy Smith, one of the greatest technicians of the Hammond B3, is among Lonnie Smith&#039;s strongest influences.  But to my ears, there is something more subtle at play with Lonnie Smith - a concentration on groove, on creating interesting musical stories which go beyond quantity of notes.  Here&#039;s what I mean - I couldn&#039;t sit still while listening to his version of &quot;Come Together&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;451&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/cmUye60jY8c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Lonnie Smith&#039;s signature playing style is only one part of what has earned him world-wide acclaim since the late 1960&#039;s - he&#039;s also a great writer.  His compositions reflect trends in contemporary jazz but also the contemporary musics happening around jazz.  He&#039;s always experimenting with new sounds and musical techniques; his writing has certainly been noticed within the jazz community, but also in other genres - he&#039;s been sampled by rap, dance and house musicians, and is credited as a creator of the acid jazz genre.  Here&#039;s a sample featuring various aspects of Dr. Lonnie Smith:  his interpretation of other music (in this case, &quot;Beehive&quot; by Harold Mabern); his arranging (in this case, for his octet); the groove he establishes with his playing; the two outstanding musicians who will be joining him in Toronto (Jonathan Kreisberg on guitar, Jamire Williams on drums):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/yAN6HqyfZfw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I saw his trio in New York back in January of 2013, I was enthralled - the three musicians each understood completely what the other was doing, and what the goal of the performance seemed to be:  great music, served groovily.  I was interested too in his bandmates - two musicians both half his age.  To me, that demonstrates Smith&#039;s desire to be constantly moving forward, exploring some of the new sounds created by younger musicians.   Here&#039;s a clip featuring snippets of the trio, along with commentary by each of the musicians.  What impresses me, beyond the playing, is the respect each musician has for the other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/44970400&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Inside, outside, uptempo, bluesy or ballad, Dr. Lonnie Smith brings his unique performing approach to every tune.  Smith, Jonathan Kreisberg and Jamire Williams perform on Monday, June 24, 10 pm at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004A978F9631A7?brand=tojazz&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, go to the &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/dr-lonnie-smith&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drlonniesmith.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.drlonniesmith.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/drlonniesmithweb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lonnie Smith is an unparalleled musician, composer, performer and recording artist. An authentic master and guru of the Hammond B-3 organ for over five decades, he has been featured on over seventy albums, and has recorded and performed with a virtual “Who’s Who” of the greatest jazz, blues and R&amp;amp;B giants in the industry. Consequently, he has often been hailed as a “Legend,” a “Living Musical Icon,” and as the most creative jazz organist by a slew of music publications. Jazz Times magazine describes him as “a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a turban!” Always ahead of the curve, it is no surprise Dr. Smith’s fan-base is truly worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since leaving the Blue Note stable in the ‘70s, Dr. Smith has recorded for a slew of record labels, including Kudu, Groove Merchant, T.K., Scufflin’, Criss Cross and Palmetto, ascending the charts many times. His unpredictable, insatiable musical taste illustrates that no genre is safe, as Lonnie has recorded everything from covers of the Beatles, the Stylistics and the Eurythmics, to tribute albums of Jimi Hendrix, John Coltrane and Beck–all by employing ensembles ranging from a trio to a fifteen-piece big band. Moreover, many of Doc’s recent compositions reflect dramatic ethereal qualities and orchestration that elicit movie scores or soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Smith has been amused to find himself sampled in rap, dance and house grooves while being credited as a forefather of acid jazz. When questioned about his consistent interest in music some consider outside the jazz “mainstream,” Lonnie shrugs. “Jazz is American Classical,” he proclaims. “And this music is a reflection of what’s happening at the time… The organ is like the sunlight, rain and thunder…it’s all the worldly sounds to me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And worldly awards have followed. Since 1969, when Downbeat magazine named him “Top Organist” of that year, Dr. Lonnie Smith has won a plethora of critics’ polls as the world’s premier organist/keyboardist. Moreover, he was recently inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame, as well as the Jazz Organ Fellowship’s Hall of Fame. In 2012, Dr. Smith launched his own recording and production company—Pilgrimage Productions—for which he will soon release a blazing new live trio album, as well as the first installment of the Dr. Smith songbook series, a program designed to shed light on the organist’s vast (yet often overlooked) career as a composer.&lt;/p&gt;

The 2010 US release of &#039;Tension&#039; by Clayton Doley&#039;s Organ Donors received glowing reviews and has cast Clayton as a rising star in the blues and jazz idiom.&lt;br /&gt;
Drawn to the Hammond B3 organ from a very early age, he is a master of the instrument. He has dedicated his life to exploring the full potential of the B3 and utilizing it&#039;s dynamics, depth of tone and it&#039;s bass pedals. Not just an organist, Clayton has a deep and rich and soulful singing voice and his bluesy songwriting combines modern structure and harmony with thoughtful and sensitive lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;
Invited to Canada by Harry Manx, whom he plays with regularly around North America, Australia and Europe. Clayton has spent much of 2011 immersing himself in Toronto&#039;s vibrant scene, playing regularly at the world famous Hammond Organ Club, The Orbit Room, in between tours.&lt;br /&gt;
In Australia Clayton has had a long history as a television musical director for the now legendary shows &#039;Good News Week&#039; and &#039;The Sideshow&#039;. He has also toured the world over with artists such as Eugene &#039;Hideaway&#039; Bridges (USA), A Camp (Sweden), Silverchair (Australia), The Divinyls (Australia), and Harry Manx (Canada). Clayton is a sought after session musician who has played on hundreds of albums as well as a brilliant band leader who is in great demand on the Australian festival circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Tony Monaco?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-tony-monaco</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/tony-monaco-trio&quot;&gt;Tony Monaco Trio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&#039;t remember exactly when I first heard jazz organ.  I do know it was Jimmy Smith, and I do remember exactly how I reacted.  I remember thinking:  &quot;Are you kidding?  Can music feel this good?  Can it groove this hard?&quot; The answer, of course, is yes...and Tony Monaco is bringing that groove to the TD Toronto Jazz Festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it about jazz organ - and Hammond B3 - that gets me moving?  It&#039;s hard to explain.  I&#039;ve always liked Gospel music, so it could be that organ is so frequently heard in that genre; it could be that the B3 is such a bluesy instrument; or it could be the almost incessant energy that each B3 player seems to bring to the instrument:  a driving, swinging, unstoppable musical force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former teacher (I believe it was Alex Dean in third-year jazz improv class) once said that &quot;Talking about music is like dancing about architecture.&quot;  That is, I won&#039;t spend too much time trying to describe the sound or the feeling produced by the B3 - I&#039;ll let Tony Monaco demonstrate (watch at least until 2 minutes in - it&#039;s worth it!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/ZT9TcYi3D5A&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/ZT9TcYi3D5A&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;color1=0x234900&amp;amp;color2=0x4e9e00&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What you may notice in this clip is the absence of a bass guitar.  Not only does Tony play incredible solo and melody lines, but he&#039;s covering the bass lines too (as all B3 players do) - either with his left hand or with his feet.  You can imagine, as the tempos start to climb, how acrobatic he has to be.  But he&#039;s got the chops...here&#039;s a clip from Tony jamming at a music conference in 2004 (notice about 30 seconds in how he sustains a note with his right thumb, plays lines with the rest of his right hand, and the bass with his left hand!):&lt;/p&gt;

Tony Monaco started his musical career on accordion at age eight.  When he was 16, he got an encouraging call from master jazz organist Jimmy Smith, and four years later Tony was invited to play at Jimmy&#039;s club in California.  Over the years Tony pursued a variety of opportunities within and outside the music business, but when he met Joey DeFrancesco in 2000, his career as an organist took off.  He worked with Joey on several albums and started touring internationally.  Since then he&#039;s played around the world with some of the biggest international jazz musicians, has developed organ teaching methods, and started his own record label (Chicken Coup Records).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Joey DeFrancesco</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/joey-defrancesco</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joeydefrancesco.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.joeydefrancesco.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Joey_DeFrancesco.gif&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music of Joey DeFrancesco -- an important force in the revival of the Hammond B-3 organ as a jazz instrument -- runs the gamut from soul-jazz and bluesy grooves à la Jimmy Smith to hard bop to the more advanced modal style of Coltrane disciple Larry Young. Born in Springfield, PA (near Philadelphia), on April 10, 1971, DeFrancesco was the son of another Philly-area jazz organist, Papa John DeFrancesco, and the grandson of multi-instrumentalist Joe DeFrancesco, who worked with the Dorsey Brothers. He began playing piano at age four and quickly switched to his father&#039;s instrument, preferring the sound of the Hammond B-3 over the modern synthesizers that had become the dominant alternative to piano. He began sitting in at his father&#039;s club gigs around age six; by age ten, he was performing paying gigs on the weekends and sitting in with artists like Jack McDuff and Groove Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFrancesco continued to study through high school, drawing from Philadelphia&#039;s rich jazz organ heritage and the numerous veteran players who still found work on the city&#039;s club scene. At 16, he was the first recipient of the Philadelphia Jazz Society&#039;s McCoy Tyner Scholarship, and was also a finalist in the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition. He met Miles Davis on a local television show and impressed the trumpeter enough that DeFrancesco was invited on tour following his high-school graduation in 1988. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After appearing on the well-received Live Around the World and Amandla albums, DeFrancesco scored a solo deal with Columbia and released his debut as a leader, All of Me, in 1989. Four more Columbia albums followed (Where Were You?, Part III, Reboppin&#039;, Live at the Five Spot), one per year, and DeFrancesco&#039;s reputation grew steadily, helped by the fact that as a virtuosic yet vintage-style organist, he was something of an anomaly on the early-&#039;90s jazz scene. His arrival presaged -- and, in fact, helped kick-start -- a renewal of interest in organ jazz of all stripes, and he remained one of the most versatile and advanced of the new breed of players; inspired by Davis, he even picked up the trumpet as a second instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After parting ways with Columbia, DeFrancesco recorded sets for Muse and Big Mo, and began working extensively with guitarist John McLaughlin. His appearance on 1994&#039;s After the Rain and his subsequent international tour with McLaughlin brought him to a whole new audience. He spent the next few years working mostly as a sideman, however, and returned to the studio under his own name in 1998, recording All or Nothing at All for Big Mo; he also appeared with his father on All in the Family for High Note. The following year brought The Champ, a tribute to Jimmy Smith (also on High Note), and a new record deal with Concord Jazz, which kicked off with the Mafia movie soundtrack tribute Goodfellas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeFrancesco finally teamed up with longtime hero Jimmy Smith for 2000&#039;s Incredible!, and issued the Concord follow-up Singin&#039; and Swingin&#039; in 2001, which spotlighted his easygoing vocals. In the meantime, he also continued to record sessions for High Note, including the sequel The Champ: Round 2 (2000) and another tribute to one of his influences, The Philadelphia Connection: A Tribute to Don Patterson (2002). Always a busy and prolific artist, DeFrancesco released five albums in the next five years: 2003&#039;s Falling in Love Again, which featured jazz singer Joe Doggs; 2004&#039;s Plays Sinatra His Way; 2005&#039;s Legacy, again with Jimmy Smith; and 2006&#039;s Organic Vibes. Live: The Authorized Bootleg followed in 2007 from Concord Records, while Joey D! appeared in 2008. In 2009, DeFrancesco paid tribute to one his idols with Finger Poppin: Celebrating the Music of Horace Silver. Steve Huey, All Music Guide&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tony Monaco Trio</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/tony-monaco-trio</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.b3monaco.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.b3monaco.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/Tony_Monaco.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrated Hammond B-3 Jazz Organ wizard Tony Monaco began his keyboard life at age eight, on the accordion. When he was twelve, his destiny as a jazz organist was sealed when he first heard Jimmy Smith. On his sixteenth birthday, he received an encouraging phone call from Jimmy Smith, who soon became his Mentor/Teacher. Four years later, Jimmy Smith invited Tony to come play at his club in California - a peak lifetime experience for Tony.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2000, Tony met fellow jazz organist  Joey DeFrancesco, who offered to produce a debut CD for him. This collaboration resulted in the critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Burnin Grooves&lt;/i&gt;. The international success of the recording served as the catalyst for regional and national tours. This success was followed by two more releases for Summit Records that received critical acclaim and significant sales, charting in the &lt;i&gt;Jazzweek&lt;/i&gt; Top 10. In September 2003, Summit Records released &lt;i&gt;A New Generation&lt;/i&gt;, a unique recording featuring both Tony&#039;s and Joey DeFrancesco&#039;s Trios.  As Tony’s reputation has grown, he has been blessed to play with some of greatest musicians in jazz, including Mel Lewis, Lewis Nash, Red Holloway, Plas Johnson, Sonny Fortune, Jon Faddis, Adam Nussbaum, Bruce Forman, Harvey Mason, Chester Thompson (drummer) Herlin Riley, Matt Wilson, Jeff Clayton, Terrell Stafford, Eric Alexander, Late Bobby Durham, Russell Malone, Peter Bernstein, Paul Bollenback, Bruce Forman, Kevin Mahogany, Victor Lewis, and Pat Martino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony is an accomplished teacher as well. In addition to private students, classes and clinics, Tony has produced a series of instructional DVDs titled &lt;i&gt;Playing Jazz Hammond&lt;/i&gt; that have quickly become indispensable for any serious student of the organ. Tony has decided to expand his catalogue and has created MotherHenMusicEd.com where he will soon be adding Gospel organists, Beginner &amp;amp; Primer series, Piano, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, Tony maintains a busy world touring schedule, including festival appearances in Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Germany, Italy, Scotland, Holland and Spain, as well as Canada and the US. Now Executive Producer of the Summit Records subsidiary Chicken Coup Records, he has recorded and released CDs for several undiscovered organists around the globe, and his role as educator has allowed him to spread and cultivate many new hopefuls to the art of the jazz organ.&lt;/p&gt;
