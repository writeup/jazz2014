 <title>What&#039;s so good about Joey DeFrancesco?</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-joey-defrancesco</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/joey-defrancesco&quot;&gt;Joey DeFrancesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m trying to figure out where exactly my love of the Hammond B3 organ sound comes from.  I didn&#039;t grow up listening to blues or gospel; I went to synagogue, not church; and my record collection is more big band and trumpet than keys.  But somewhere along the way, I took out a Jimmy Smith CD from the library and something clicked.  Since then, a well-played gospelly, bluesy organ has resonated somewhere deep within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we&#039;re going to talk about Hammond B3 organ, we must talk about Joey DeFrancesco.  Essentially, Joey DeFrancesco encapsulates in his playing everything that comes to mind when I think about great organ:  he swings like crazy; his vocabulary includes all of the blues and gospel licks which sound so great on the instrument; and his playing exudes the sense of fun for which I feel the instrument may have been created. Let&#039;s launch right in to a track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/dFcVaitADW8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In that one track, he shows off what&#039;s made him one of the best in the world: gospelly goodness off the top, great blues licks, and technical virtuosity.  What you might not have noticed - especially if you haven&#039;t seen many organists play live - is what&#039;s happening underneath the keyboard. While his hands are busy playing the chords and melodies (and soloing), Joey&#039;s feet are busy holding down the bass line.  I don&#039;t know enough about how organists train to suggest that all organists learn this skill; what I do know - having seen a few - is that not all organists use their feet in performance. Just another notch in the &quot;complete package&quot; column for DeFrancesco! Here&#039;s a clip demonstrating his fancy footwork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/XfolH2D-ZzI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Any great musician - and any great combo - knows exactly when to ratchet up the tension or the excitement in a performance.  For me, somehow the sound of the organ heightens that musical tension even more.  Maybe it&#039;s the  way certain chords sound and feel especially crunchy - so when they resolve, the resolution is particularly satisfactory. I&#039;m not sure.  What I do know is that Joey DeFrancesco understands perfectly how to create and release musical tension, and how best to use the instrument to his advantage. Here&#039;s a clip of two organ masters - Joey along with Dr. Lonnie Smith - which demonstrates two different styles of organ playing:&lt;/p&gt;

Joey DeFrancesco takes the stage along with Jeff Parker (guitar) and George Fludas (drums) on June 25, 8 pm at the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/horseshoe-tavern&quot;&gt;Horseshoe Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C91BE51B7A7&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, visit his &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/joey-defrancesco-trio&quot;&gt;concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s so good about Bobby McFerrin</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/guide/whats-so-good-about-bobby-mcferrin</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-artistref field-type-node-reference field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Artist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/artist/bobby-mcferrin-spirityouall&quot;&gt;Bobby McFerrin - spirityouall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I&#039;m supposed to go &quot;beyond the bio&quot; with these posts, but here&#039;s a line from Bobby McFerrin&#039;s bio which I think captures what makes him so special as an artist:  &quot;The 10-time Grammy winner has blurred the distinction between pop music and fine art, goofing around barefoot in the world’s finest concert halls, exploring uncharted vocal territory, inspiring a whole new generation of a cappella singers and the beatbox movement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with a musical master, a concert by Bobby McFerrin is so much more that just a concert - it&#039;s an experience. The instrument on display is certainly impressive - whether alone on stage or accompanied by a full orchestra, what he&#039;s able to do with his unique, multi-octave voice, beatboxing and body percussion is unmatched and enthralling. But for me, it&#039;s the rest of the package - the joy which emanates from the stage when he sings; the way in which he engages the audience - both through his stage persona and literally via audience participation - which makes Bobby McFerrin a must-see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than have me try to explain Bobby&#039;s approach to singing, check out this clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/81uJZIF9TCs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The clip above demonstrates Bobby&#039;s immense talent as a performer, but also  his commitment to sharing the joy of singing, and his passion for education.  It&#039;s apt that the video was taken on a day called Sing! Day of Song, in front of 60,000 other singers.  In his own words:  &quot;I try to sing the way I sing in my kitchen, because I just can’t help myself. I want audiences to leave the theatre and sing in their own kitchens the next morning. I want to bring audiences into the incredible feeling of joy and freedom I get when I sing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite videos of Bobby McFerrin I saw thanks to Facebook - someone posted it on their page.  It&#039;s not often that I include a video from the World Science Festival in the Artistic Director&#039;s Guide to Jazz…but I think you&#039;ll see why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ne6tB2KiZuk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a previous life, I managed a children&#039;s choir, and the Artistic Director always used to say &quot;If you can talk, you can sing.&quot; I feel Bobby McFerrin is always trying to remind us of the same idea.  We&#039;re not going to be able to do what he does, but we can share in the joy which he gets from singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his 2014 TD Toronto Jazz Festival appearance, he&#039;ll be performing music from his spirityouall project, in which he &quot;re-imagines Americana with beloved spirituals and original songs, raising the roof with joyful grooves.&quot; He&#039;ll have a full band with him on stage, but his voice will be on full display.  Here&#039;s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/eiEUaYd2MEg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I can&#039;t wait.  Bobby McFerrin - spirityouall performs Friday, June 27, 8 pm on the &lt;a href=&quot;/venue/toronto-star-stage-nathan-phillips-square&quot; target=&quot;_&quot;&gt;Toronto Star Stage&lt;/a&gt; at Nathan Phillips Square.  Local soul extravaganza the Soul Nannies opens up.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10004C9000ABD377&quot;&gt;Buy tickets now&lt;/a&gt; or, for more information, &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/bobby-mcferrin-spirityouall&quot;&gt;visit the concert page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Shemekia Copeland</title>

She’s opened for the Rolling Stones, headlined at the Chicago Blues Festival and numerous festivals around the world, scored critics choice awards on both sides of the Atlantic (The New York Times and The Times of London), shared the stage with such luminaries as Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Mick Jagger, and Eric Clapton, and has even performed at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama. Heir to the rich tradition of soul-drenched divas like Ruth Brown, Etta James and Koko Taylor, the singer was presented with Taylor’s crown by her daughter, Cookie, on June 12, 2011 at the Chicago Blues Festival and given the honor of the new “Queen of the Blues” by official proclamation of the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copeland’s passion for singing, matched with her huge, blast-furnace voice, gives her music a timeless power and a heart-pounding urgency. Her music comes from deep within her soul and from the streets where she grew up, surrounded by the everyday sounds of the city – street performers, gospel singers, blasting radios, bands in local parks and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dirty Dozen Brass Band</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/dirty-dozen-brass-band</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dirtydozenbrass.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.dirtydozenbrass.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/DDBB_20doz_promo3.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;210&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To describe how the Dirty Dozen Brass Band has arrived at its 35th Anniversary, trumpet player Gregory Davis employs a tried-and true New Orleans-centric analogy: “It ends up being like a pot of gumbo – you drop in a little okra, drop in a little shrimp, you drop in some crabs. Before you know it, you’ve mixed in all these different ingredients and you’ve got a beautiful soup. That was our approach to music early on and it still is today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appetite for musicological adventure, a commitment to honor tradition while not being constrained by it, and a healthy sense of humor have brought the world-traveling Dirty Dozen Brass Band to this remarkable juncture in an already storied career. To celebrate its 35th, the band is releasing Twenty Dozen, the septet’s first studio release in six years. The new album, cut at the Music Shed in New Orleans, reunites the band with producer Scott Billington, who helmed DDBB’s first major-label release, Voodoo, in 1989. It’s a resolutely upbeat effort that seamlessly blends R&amp;amp;B, jazz, funk, Afro-Latino grooves, some Caribbean flavor, and even a Rihanna cover. Twenty Dozen mirrors in flow and feel a vibrant DDBB live set. The disc reaches an exuberant peak with a medley of New Orleans staples, including a particularly high-spirited rendering of “When the Saints Go Marching In.” The final track – or, as Lewis puts it, “the after-party” – is an audience encore favorite, the ribald “Dirty Old Man,” with Lewis doing an outstanding job in the title role. Twenty Dozen, says Lewis, is “classic Dirty Dozen. It’s got something for your mind, body, and soul. We’re gonna get you one way or another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional numbers infused with a DDBB flavor have always been crowd-pleasing staples of the group’s repertoire, it’s the Dirty Dozen Brass Band’s willingness to look beyond the New Orleans songbook and find connections amongst a wider range of music that has endeared them to critics, fellow musicians and a multi-generational, global audience. &lt;/p&gt;

Still barely in his 30s, the Louisiana born axeman and songsmith has been selling millions of albums, throwing singles into the Top 10, shining a light on the rich blues of the past and forging ahead with his own modern twist on a classic sound he has embodied since his teens. He met Stevie Ray Vaughan at 7, shared the stage with New Orleans legend Bryan Lee at13. As an adult, he continues to create genre-defining blues-infused rock n&#039; roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny Wayne Shepherd&#039;s How I Go not only serves as a strong reminder of the chops that caused Guitar World to place him right behind B.B. King and Eric Clapton on their list of blues guitarists, but it&#039;s the strongest indication yet of his gifted songwriting talent. The album pairs Kenny&#039;s deeply soulful and impassioned takes on classic material like Bessie Smith&#039;s &quot;Backwater Blues,&quot; Albert King&#039;s &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; and The Beatles &quot;Yer Blues&quot; alongside the strongest writing and co-writing of his career thus far. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Robert Randolph &amp; the Family Band</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/robert-randolph-family-band</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robertrandolph.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.robertrandolph.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/robert%20randolph.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Robert Randolph talks about his new album, Lickety Split, a few words come up over and over—”joy,” “freedom,” “energy.” Which is no surprise, really, because those are the same things that immediately spring into a listener’s mind when these twelve tracks from the virtuoso pedal steel guitarist and his longtime accompanists, the Family Band, explode out of the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My thing is really upbeat, uptempo, with great guitar riffs,” says Randolph, summarizing his musical ambitions, “but also catchy choruses and lyrics that someday will make this music into classic tunes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Randolph &amp;amp; The Family Band first gained national attention with the release of the album Live at the Wetlands in 2002. The band followed with three studio recordings over the next eight years—Unclassified, Colorblind, and We Walk This Road—which, together with tireless touring and unforgettable performances at such festivals as Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, won them an expanding and passionate fan base. Randolph’s unprecedented prowess on his instrument garnered him a spot on Rolling Stone’s “100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time” list, and also attracted the attention of such giants as Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana, who have collaborated with him on stage and in the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new label, a new dedication to his craft, and a new sense of responsibility in his life off-stage, it seems like Lickety Split might also represent the urgency Robert Randolph is bringing to all of his efforts these days. “I’m still undiscovered, and that’s really the best thing about it,” he says. “Now we have the chance to present the music right, and have the story told right, and for me to be focused on being an ambassador for inner-city kids and a role model, and also an ambassador for my instrument and as an artist.

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmc.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.tmc.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/MassChoir_Image.jpg&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Toronto Mass Choir (TMC) continues to be on the cutting edge of the Canadian gospel music scene bringing their distinct gospel sound to the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMC’s music incorporates contemporary gospel, traditional gospel and Caribbean music influences. In particular TMC’s combination of gospel lyrics with a variety of musical styles has resulted in a style unique in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeds of this traveling ministry were sown during the choir’s initial recording session in October 1988. The choir’s debut album, Great Is Thy Glory, released in April 1990 on the Micah Communications label was re-released as The Early Years. TMC’s second live recording, God is our Hope was released in 1994, followed in April 1998 by its Juno nominated album, Follow Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2002, Instrument of Praise was released.  That year the Gospel Music Association Canada (GMAC) awarded TMC a Covenant Award for Best Urban/Contemporary Gospel Album of the Year.  In 2003, they picked up a Juno Award for Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year; the Vibe Award for Urban/Soul Album of the Year, and the Urban Music Association of Canada Award for Gospel Recording of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2005, the choir broke new ground, using a 20-piece orchestra on The Live Experience, which also garnered a GMAC, Covenant Award in 2006 for Traditional Gospel Album of the Year. A Shai Award, the gospel music people’s choice prize, for Urban/Soul album of the year followed in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September 2007 release of Going Home, a full Caribbean gospel album, showcased the choir’s soulful style of reggae, calypso, ska and new sounds with the fusion of jazz and reggae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of their seventh album in 2010, A Christmas Gift marked the first Contemporary Gospel Choir Christmas CD release in Canada and showcases TMC at its best.  A Christmas Gift also won 2 Covenant Music awards including ‘Seasonal Album of the Year’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, as they entered their 25th performance season, Toronto Mass Choir released ‘25’, a CD featuring highlights from over their recording career as well as 4 previously unreleased songs from their early years. That same year, TMC was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Gospel Music Association of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Burke, a graduate of McMaster University, the Royal Conservatory of Music and a Professor of music at York University, is the director of the diversified group of singers and musicians along with her husband, Oswald Burke, who is their Executive Producer. “Toronto Mass Choir is proof that Gospel music is alive and well in Canada and it is has been our privilege to share the Good News of the Gospel for almost 25 years,” said Burke. Burke also conducts numerous gospel music workshops in Canada and internationally. TMC’s official 25th anniversary is October 15, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now 35-strong plus a four-piece band, the not for profit choir consists of adult members who are from various local church denominations including Baptist, Church of God, Wesleyan, Missionary, and Pentecostal.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1996 he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and in 2007 his jazz/rock composition “Spinning Wheel” was enshrined in the Songwriter’s Hall Of Fame. In 2010 David received his star on Canada’s Walk Of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David began his music career in the early ‘60s, working the clubs on Toronto’s Yonge Street, where he discovered his love of singing and playing the blues. Before moving to New York City in 1967, David fronted a couple of local bands, first The Shays and then The Bossmen, one of the earliest rock bands with significant jazz influences. But the real success came only a few difficult years later when he joined Blood, Sweat &amp;amp; Tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David&#039;s 1968 debut album with the band sold ten million copies worldwide. The self-titled record topped the Billboard album chart for seven weeks, and charted for a staggering 109 weeks. It won an unprecedented five Grammy awards, including Album Of The Year and Best Performance By A Male Vocalist. It featured three hit singles, &quot;You Made Me So Very Happy&quot; &quot;And When I Die&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Spinning Wheel&quot; as well as an irresistible rendition of Billie Holiday&#039;s &quot;God Bless The Child&quot; that became David’s signature song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With David fronting the band, BS&amp;amp;T continued with a string of hit albums, including Blood Sweat &amp;amp; Tears 3 which featuring such high points as David’s &quot;Lucretia MacEvil,&quot; and Carole King’s &quot;Hi-De-Ho,&quot; and BS&amp;amp;T 4 which yielded another Clayton-Thomas penned hit single, &quot;Go Down Gamblin’.&quot; In 2004 David left New York City for Toronto and launched an All-Star 10-piece band. Since then, he has toured and recorded almost a dozen albums under his own name. In his autobiography entitled Blood Sweat and Tears (Penguin, 2010) David gives a heartfelt, first-hand account of his amazing journey from street life to stardom.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mark &quot;Bird&quot; Stafford</title>
 <link>http://jazz.to/artist/mark-bird-stafford</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-web field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div  class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markbirdstafford.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.markbirdstafford.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-photo field-type-image field-label-hidden field-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jazz.to/sites/default/files/mark%20stafford.jpg&quot; width=&quot;230&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body field&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be so appropriate to be able to imply that Mark “Bird” Stafford earned his nickname from his ability to soar on the harmonica in the fiery fashion of Charlie Parker. Sorry. Different “Bird”. But – like Parker – Mark shares a phenomenal passion for making music and, as he’s been performing since he was knee-high to a sharecropper, he’s developed a musical voice that’s become somewhat legendary in these parts – and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For good reason. A serious student of “fat tone” harmonica, he subscribes to the teachings of the masters: Sonny Boy Williamson, Little Walter Jacobs, Big Walter Horton, Junior Wells and James Cotton, imbuing what he’s learned with a healthy dose off his own creativity. He also injects these influences with the spirited new blood of cats including Kim Wilson, William Clarke and Rod Piazza. That’s a serious stack of mentorship but The Bird has listened and listened hard. And he plays back the lessons learned with all the love and respect befitting a forever blues student who is more than ready to register his own contribution to the genre. From the frenzy he can generate from a crowd and on a dance floor to the smooth, mercurial side of his musical personality, Mark pours it on with a highly-polished singing voice and the comparably subtle, expressive tones of his accomplished harpmanship. Those who have been to Bird’s church are the first to testify but never the last.&lt;/p&gt;
